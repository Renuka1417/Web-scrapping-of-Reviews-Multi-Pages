      "['Omg! This place was the best! The best everything! Literally. The ambiance. On point. The service. Amazing. The food. Mouthwateringly DELICIOUS. This place is a must visit.', \"Visited Nue last night for dinner and loved the experience! This was my second visit to Nue and I was excited to see that the menu had been updated, or maybe I just forgot what it was previously :)I've tried the South African Bunny Chow in the Past and that tastes like a combination of African, South Asian, and East Asian flavors. Amazing. This time I tried the Pineapple Cornbread (4/5) as an appetizer. This was so nice and buttery, not sure if i got any pineapple taste, but it's topped with coconut which I was pleasantly surprised by! I wish the bread was slightly more moist, but still a great dish.I also tried the the Balinese Barbecued Spare Ribs (4/5). The meat was cooked very well and the dish looked so appetizing - wish I had gotten a picture! I did feel like the sauce was missing some salt, but it helped to eat the meat with the side of jasmine rice that came with. That really completed the flavors.I loved coming back here because the menu has so many unique and the ambience is fun and eclectic. ALSO - WE SAW TREVOR NOAH HERE! Really cool to see a celebrity around Seattle!\", 'Came here for dinner with friends and really liked all the dishes we got! We did tapas style and shared, we got 4 dishes to share for 4 people + my favorite was the bunny chow, pretty unique and good flavor+ the wings had a perfect soy glaze and were also very good+ my cocktail was sweet and enjoyable as well as pretty, wish it had a cooler presentation tho+ cool decor and interior + they have communal tables It does get packed so try to reserve in advance (very easy thru Yelp). Saw someone also celebrate a birthday here.- bit pricey', 'I using the term \"organized calamity\" a proper term to describe a place? Thats the best way I could describe the NUE. Its a small, garage-like place that gives exactly that impression. Like someone had cleaned out their garage and decided to make a restaurant out o the space that was now available. Im not saying that in a BAD way.\\xa0The decorations are eclectic. If you remember the old BENNIGANS way of decorating, this is done in the same fashion. The thing that elevates the food here from most places, is their use of Asian, Indian and Thai ingredients to specialize their food. While sitting on a wobbly stool, I enjoyed Chengdu Spicy Jumbo Chicken Wings Nue\\'s Famous Double Dipped, Crispy Fried Wings with Green Szechuan Peppercorn, Fish Sauce, Lime, Chili, Basil, Thai Chili & Mint. The presentation of the wings was BRILLANT as well. They used the simple art of stacking them on wooden skewers.\\xa0Sadly, the beer menu was lacking but was helped by an inventive drink menu. This is most definitely as come-as-you-are type place. Where if you dont expect much and your able to look past its seemingly \"I dont give a fuck\" attitude, you might be pleasently surprised. I would recommend this as a work night, meet up type of place and not a place you plan around a date or a night out.', 'I hadn\\'t heard of this restaurant until we were invited by our friends who craved their Tea Leaf Salad (apparently the only place in Seattle to grab one). We got there at 6:30 and were seated in the tent outside. Now, the tent was fine - it had heaters and the noise wasn\\'t bad - BUT, you want to be inside this restaurant. The interior and energy inside shouldn\\'t be missed. So we talked to the host, and got a reservation for later in the evening.Seating is pretty communal but it isn\\'t hard to keep to your own group. Once we sat down inside we got a round of tasty beverages and began to order basically everything. I got the Beetle Juice (a vodka martini where the vodka is infused with large water beetles) and I gotta tell ya, that flavor is something else. It\\'s like citrusy, anise-y, cotton candy.. a sipper for sure. And when you think \"There\\'s NO WAY the beetle will actually taste this way!\" It does. It 1000% does, and it\\'s wild. Now, you don\\'t get much put of the beetle because s TON of work goes into breaking it down (yup, YOU do that). But now I can say I\\'ve had it, so done.We also started with the Brussels sprouts, the tea leaf salad, and the cornbread. I think the pile of coconut on the cornbread is unnecessary, but otherwise, solid starters.The French Tacos and frites I want to eat all the time. My partner got the Bunny Chow, and our dinner guests got the spare ribs and another order of French Tacos. So we hope to return to NUE when they\\'ve changed up their menu a bit (though, let\\'s be real, I\\'m getting French Tacos again).', 'This was my first time visiting Nue for brunch, and everything was as delicious as ever. I had the carrot kale salad, which I originally tried during restaurant week and just had to have again. The combination of almonds, shredded dates, and well massaged kale is absolutely perfect.I love the ambience of this restaurant, as everything is travel-themed, down to the atlas books in which the check is served.', 'Excellent service from the kindest wait staff. The food here is absolutely phenomenal! I was so impressed by how authentic and flavorful each dish was, from the bunny chow to the Irish potatoes! The inside of the restaurant is so homey and well decorated. I would definitely love to come back to try the entire menu! Every single thing looks and sounds so good!', \"Unique to the T! What a great concept! Communal seating! From the decor to the food, everything was so well thought out and perfect! I could go there over and over again for their menu! It's just different! Nothing is standard, everything is original and very Nue!\", \"Imagine a place where you can eat a three course meal with food originating from three different countries that are located on three different continents. That's exactly what you get when you're at Nue! I went during Restaurant Week so I got to try three different dishes. I started with the Syrian kale carrot salad which had a nice citrus tone to it. It had the perfect lightness to start the dinner. Next, I tried the South African bunny chow as my main entrée. It was full of a lot of complex and dense flavors. I really liked it! But it was too big for me to finish so I took the rest home. The last dish I had was the South African chocolate malva. It didn't taste like chocolate really but it had a very natural sweet taste to it with notes of brown sugar, honey, and nuttiness. Overall the food was very good! And there are so many other dishes I'd love to try too! I'm pretty sure they have a brunch so I would love to go some time!\", 'We came on a Tuesday around 5pm and it was super easy to walk in and get a seat! I love that they have a diverse offering of international cuisine... and their cocktails are so unique!We had to try the beer with the whipped cream which is... exactly how it sounds! The Scandinavian liquorice drink was too strong for my friend, so I happily drank it instead. For food, we ordered the bunny chow, beetles, and chicken wings. The beetles are a MUST if you are always hungry for new and unusual flavors. Its truly nothing like I have ever tasted before! But there isn\\'t much meat to \"eat.\" Its more about sucking the flavor... so don\\'t expect to get full from the beetles!', \"Amazing. Such unique flavors and atmosphere. Like most people we had the Bunnychow - must have - and then a new item- the Istanbul Islak Burger / such unique flavors it's hard to describe. Almost forgot the Brussels Sprouts - if your a fan get these Great experience will be back\", \"I am very surprised with this. I'm usually not a fan of curry, but this was really hood South African curry I thinm from the Restaurant week menu. I love the entrée, and the appetizers. The hummis and pita was alsgold. I didn't like my dessert though, just because I was expecting more like a lava cake but not really like a bread dessert,since the appetizers and entrées were all bread based already so I needed to clean my palate with something else. The drinks though were delish! Parking is a nightmare.. so take that into account since it's just street parking.\", \"Wait time: There were two of us and we barely waited to get seated in a Sunday afternoon. Food: I was a bit disappointed at the food. We ordered the corn bread, the sunny bunny, and the Chengdu Chicken and waffles. The sunny bunny was flavorful and delicious. The corn bread was a bit dry but tasted great with the roasted coconut flakes. But the Chengdu chicken and waffles was very disappointing. I saw many people ordered this and assumed it would be delicious. However, the chicken wings were flavorless without the sauce. Yet there was not enough sauce. I had to try really hard to dip every piece of chicken wings in the limited sauce on the plate. I have to give the Sichuan peppercorns they used some credit because that would numb your lips and tongue, which made it Chengdu-ish. But the waffles were burnt and super dry. I didn't even finish the waffles. I may come back again, but will not order Chengdu chicken and waffles anymore.\", \"Summary: small restaurant. Very diverse cuisine. Reasonable price, but portion may be smaller.Nue is the kind of restaurants for when you can't decide what cuisine you want, because they have a lot of choices from difference countries. I had the Filipino fried rice with pork. While it's not the best, it's pretty decent. The interior is quite small. You may need to share table if you're in a big group.\", \"Nue has one of the most eclectic and adventurous menus I've ever seen! It contains a few hits and a few flops, but most items are generally decent. The story behind the owner is super inspiring -- check it out! youtube.com/watch?v=hiH0…// Pineapple Cornbread - 3 stars// Thai Mang Da Na - 1 star// Beirut Style Hummus - 5 stars// Egyptian Style Brussels Sprouts - 3 stars// Ghanaian Red Red - 3 stars// South African Bunny Chow - 3 stars// French Tacos - 5 stars// Chengdu Spicy Jumbo Chicken Wings - 4 stars// Balinese Barbecued Spare Ribs - 5 stars// Lemon Olive Oil Cake - 2 stars\", \"Wow! This place is fantastic. We drove north and decided to check out Nue because their Dinner menu looked spectacular. I ordered five things off the menu, shared by 3, and wow, was I sad I got full. The flavors and textures and everything about each dish was terrific. I couldn't have been more pleased and satisfied with the food. You feel as if you are traveling worldwide with each bite you take. The experience I had at Nue was like no other restaurant experience I've had in Seattle. Give this place a try! The staff was so great on recommendations and knowledgeable on the food and cultures, enjoyable experience.\", \"One of the most interesting restaurants in this area. Enjoyed the broad scope of the menu that doesn't shy away from spices and flavor. The restaurant is very eccentrically decorated as well!The Sunny bunny curry toast was our favorite-- flavorful and satisfying as a brunch item. The wings were good too, but not mind blowing.\", \"Came here on a Sunday morning around 11:40am and although there was no wait, it was quite crowded. We shared a table outdoors with another small party and I felt that there were too many people/the music was a tad loud so it was hard to hear our own conversation. Our server was super attentive and nice, and most of the food came quite quickly, but for whatever unexplained reason, our tower of wings took an inordinately long time. The party next to us, who were seated at the same time as us, had already paid and left before we got the wings. Another party which got seated way after us got their order of Chengdu chicken and waffles before our chicken came. We were also long done with our other dishes. If we weren't sharing the dishes and instead ordered individually, there would have been one very sad and disappointed party member.The food:Pineapple cornbread: This was quite good although I tasted more coconut than pineapple. The cake was subtly sweet and moist.War chips: Not as mind-blowing as I expected from the reviews but I liked the mixture of sauces--I think one of them has a nutty flavor to it.Shakshuka: Probably my favorite dish, although I've never tasted the authentic version of the dish. The sauce was flavored with a variety of spices and wasn't too salty, although I still wish there was more flat bread to soak it all up.Chengdu tower of wings: The wings were nice and crispy and tasty but I'm not really sure how this counts as Chengdu style. It's not that spicy or numbing, and I wasn't really expecting a sweet and sour sauce. Still good nonetheless, but I just wish it arrived at our table 30 minutes earlier...\", 'Definitely a unique experience and would recommend coming just to get a variety of dishes you may not have tried before. The food is good, but the portions are pretty small. I went during restaurant week so I was able to try plenty of dishes, but most items were sadly not super memorable. Hummus had a lot of texture, but probably not worth the price. Spare ribs were slightly on the burnt side and pretty dry. I really liked the mofongo, probably the standout for me. The rest was good but nothing mindblowing.', \"Love this spot in Cap Hill. Ive been here for brunch , happy hour and dinner and have enjoyed every meal. You're seated more communal style which is fine and the food and drinks and delicious. Must orders:The Trinidadian doubles (when they are available) Chicken Wings: spicy, sweet, tangy South African Bunny Chow: a chicken curry in a bread bowl with an egg on top.They also have a very interested cocktail menu. I haven't had a drink I didn't like!\", 'Loved the ambiance. They had some cluttered kind of look going on which was unique . Service was quick , we got our food quite fast . War chips : 10/10. The peanut satay on top was nice.Sunny bunny : 10/10 husband really enjoyed this. It was warm , heart and filling. Reminded him of Indian chicken curry . Pineapple corn bread : 6/10 , it was okay . Kind of hard .Korean beer : 1/10 , can definitely skip this. The whipped cream and sprinkles on top was useless , maybe added just for the instagram look . Could have ordered some better beer. The have street side parking and also public paid parking in the adjacent buildings.', \"This place was just alright. The food looks good but doesn't translate to the taste. I got the pork with rice and egg which they said was a Filipino dish. It was just alright. The rice was too hard and dry. Wish there was more flavor than just loads of onion. Had to add the little dipping sauce to make it taste better. I honestly don't think this is worth the price...I tried my cousins tower of chicken, interesting flavors I commend that. A good kick, but i don't think I would get it again.\", \"I'm always on the hunt for a unique and eye-catching dish and this spot definitely caught my eye. With all the photos here alone, I had to order the Bunny Chow and Chengdu Spicy Wings. I'm so glad I did because both of the dishes met the expectations and more. The Bunny Chow was simply delicious..full of flavor and it had a sweetness to it. I also felt that the sauce would be lovely with rice. The wings were perfectly crispy and had a depth of flavor with a kick. Both dishes were equally quite instagram-worthy. We were seated outside, and I will say that I did not like part of the outside space concept with the chains separating the table from the sidewalk..it did not feel inviting to me and it felt quite cramped for me.\", \"Have heard about Nue through friends and have been meaning to try out this place for a little while now. I really liked the concept of the restaurant, serving dishes from many parts of the world as a way to expose us to different yet exhilarating dishes. When I came here I ordered the Chengdu Spicy Jumbo Chicken Wings, as it seems to be a popular item I often see from other food bloggers. As cited from the website, they were large wings with green Szechuan peppercorn, fish sauce, lime, chili, basil, Thai chili, and mint.The dish itself was pretty, but honestly despite the flavour profiles the dish itself wasn't all that impressive. I had expectations that the chicken would be spicier as Chengdu and Sichuanese cuisine was known for the spice, so the spice level was a bit of a letdown. The chicken itself tasted fine but it wasn't anything special.Although I wasn't completely satisfied with my order, I'm still curious to try out the other dishes. So hopefully if I do come back I hope for something better!\", \"This is probably one of the best restaurants I've been to in the Seattle area! I came at around 6pm on a Tuesday to meet up with a relative, and we were able to get seated immediately. They placed us \\xa0in the back near the bar, on one of the high tables. The vibe inside is really cool, and they also have outdoor seating if you prefer. The menu is super interesting, as it features dishes from many different backgrounds. We got the south african bunny chow, chengdu spicy jumbo chicken wings, and pineapple cornbread. The cornbread came first and was topped with coconut flakes -- it was super moist and had the perfect balance of all the flavors! The South African bunny chow was really interesting. It was basically curry in a square bread bowl -- I wasn't sure I'd like the bread, but it actually worked really well and the curry was super good. Finally, the chicken wings had to be the star of the show as they came presented in a giant tower and were perfectly crispy and seasoned well. I'd absolutely come back to try more of their unique items, and I'd highly recommend you give this place a shot too!\", 'Saw on google that this place is known for \"eclectic\" food and Nue is exactly that. Their menu had a lot of different items and the drinks were interesting. I started with the Smoldering Paloma as my drink and it was super spicy yet strong. The jalapeno kinda overpowered the paloma making it harder to drink. But if you enjoy spicy things then this drink will not disappoint. For my entree I got the peri peri chicken sandwich. I really liked the twist they did on an ordinary chicken sandwich by adding a sweet/spicy sauce to it. The reason why I gave it 3 stars is because they accidentally gave us one chicken sandwich with fries (no one in my table got fries) and the waitress said to keep it. However, she ended up charging us for it. I didn\\'t think this was fair. But other than that, service here was pretty nice. Also there was this one cocktail called the \"McNguyen\" which was a spiked vietnamese coffee.... i feel like there could be a better name for it lol', 'Shared table with other party (shoulder to shoulder). Not my cup of tea and the atmosphere is cramp.', \"This is a place you'd wanna do a work dinner at because the food is fun, shareable, and there's something for everyone (basic and more adventurous) - but it's pretty overpriced. I thought the wings and ribs were the best, and the least memorable were the hummus and both desserts (too sugary to have a real taste). $12 for half a cup of hummus and burnt pita is obscene... We also ordered the balut, bunny chow, and shark and bake, and sprouts. All were fine but would not necessarily recommend them. Drinks were tasty and typical for the cap hill area. I got the Belli Dancer and it tasted kinda mango-y.\", \"Went to brunch here with my closest friends, we canceled our reservation somewhere else when we saw the menu here. Their tequila based espresso martini was elevated! I ordered the shakshuka and the chicken&waffles to split with my friend. Wonderful portions, shareable with 2-3 people if you're ordering 2 plates like we did. Amazing staff overall.\", \"Fun international vibes and unique menu items made Nue a nice stop while I was visiting Seattle.Great for the traveler at heart especially after 2 years of the pandemic and limited overseas visits. The floor to ceiling shelves full of Asian knick knacks and pantry staples made me feel like I was back in Asia somewhere. Their QR code menu on the tables look like boarding passes, and they give you your bill in a travel book.We arrived during the happy hour. It's fairly limited so we ordered some items on the happy hour menu and some off. We had the roti and Chengdu wings, and my drink was the naranjarita which has mezcal, oj, and tamarind juice. The roti was buttery and flaky, almost like what you'd get if a croissant and a tortilla had a baby. The wings were a little spicy if you ate one of the pepper bits, but had good flavor. My drink was smoky but I really couldn't taste the tamarind.I appreciated the atmosphere and diverse menu from around the world, but it was on the expensive side even with some happy hour items.\", \"Public parking near by. Parking garage $4/hr, parking lot across the street more expensive. Cozy little area with ethnic types of decor on the walls. Four long tables that can fit 12 per table.

One of my favorite spare ribs with its unique taste. Crunchy edges, tender inside, caramelized flavor. Amazing! Lemongrass definitely adds a nice spice to it. Very flavorful! Love it.Customer service was okay. Waiter definitely lacked the experience. Didn't smile nor asked how the meal was. Would've said amazing. Overall grade 9/10 due to the amazing dish. Definitely would love to try another dish.\", \"FUXS GIVEN = 4.0*******************Food = 4A mash up of cultures this food was good. I would say slightly over priced but I don't mind paying for tasty eats UX = 4Cool kitschy spot. I really liked the cluttered decorService = 4QR menu, server was quick and courteous. Food came out promptly.\", \"I'd give it a 3.5 but will round up because honestly big props to this place for having such a diverse and unique menu. They had dishes inspired from cultures all over the world. I will say that it is on the pricier side for what you're getting. I tried the Chengdu Spicy Wings and the South African Bunny Chow.The Wings were crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside and very flavorful as well. It was a little salty though and felt more South East Asian than Chengdu because of the strong fish sauce flavor. The Bunny Chow was also pretty flavorful and was paired with a bread bowl which was an interesting choice of carb. It was quite unique but nothing here really wowed me. I would be open to trying other things on their menu as well.\", \"I had the French taco and it was exceptionally good. Mashed potatoes were not that great. Couldn't even finish them. They had no flavor to them. Service was a 3 out of 5. Could have been more helpful with representing their dishes. I wouldn't come here again. Also the place looked very dirty and dusty. They could do better.\", \"One of those places where the concept is cute but when you're trying to do the cuisines across half the planet, it's really a jack of all trades and master of none kind of deal. The place feels more gimmicky than innovative, and in a way a little reductive - it's [Country or City] then the dish, but within each country there's different styles of that dish, losing a lit bit of that distinctive indentity. Friend and I had the:Tikka masala on milk toast / Bunny chow - I mean they carved out the center of a milk toast and topped it with mediocre tikka masala. The curry was pretty bland and the chicken was dry. I was thinking how the Trader Joe's $4 tikka masala was pretty comparable, maybe better. If you don't eat away at the milk bread bowl, it becomes this really disgusting gloopy mess that was frankly unappetizing. Chengdu spicy jumbo wings - well... both of us spent our childhoods in Chengdu... and we both agreed these were basically Vietnamese fish sauce wings that anything else. The ingredients included basil, lime, fish sauce, and mint, none of which are used in Sichuan. There is apparently green peppercorns but you can't really tell. There was nary a trace of mala or any of the chilies used in Sichuan, like the gan hong la jiao. They were also super messy to eat, not a great date item to share. We also ordered some drinks but I forgot, they were were fine. The seating is pretty tight (almost uncomfortably so) and intimate. Overall I found the place both basic and adventurous - there is something for everyone, but also overpriced.\", \"If you're an adventurous eater, you'll love this place! I love the concept of housing different cuisines under one roof but the execution fell a little flat here. I came in without a reservation on a weekday and it was relatively empty, but the staff refused to seat us at a table and we had to sit at the bar style seating next to the window. The food was fun but it seemed like they were more focused on being gimmicky\", 'This place serves food from around the world. It\\'s an interesting concept--essentially what I would call travel \"favorites.\" I tried the burmese tea salad and the chicken wings. The chicken wings are to die for. Crispy skin, extra umami, I can\\'t pin point which Asian style, but super duper tasty. My top pick for wings in seattle so far!', \"There's no question that living in Seattle you've got a heavy case of decision paralysis because of all the incredible restaurants to choose from. Nue should be one of the top on your list to visit. We were excited to check out something new as has a very unique menu with flavors from all over the world. Our waitress, Kat made some great recommendations. We knew we couldn't miss the famous Chicken Wings... but also thought that the Shark and Bake was incredible. All dishes were full of flavor an packed a punch. Great cocktail menu too. We really enjoyed the Smoldering Paloma! If you're looking for something delicious and different, look no further than Nue.\", \"This restaurant has such a fun and unique decorations, and a very expansive menu covering a variety of country's dishes. Definitely a must stop restaurant for visitors! Our table ordered: pineapple coconut bread, chicken wings, and bunny chow. Every dish had amazing flavor and was very well prepared.\", \"For a date night for two, this place is perfect to be adventurous. If you like spice, Nue has got SPICE. There are so many epic layers of flavors my mouth was experiencing in every bite, it's necessary to cut it out with a refreshing drink like the Calamansi plum lemonade. My favorite combination of dishes is the the Malaysian Curry with Roti, Syrian Kale Salad, and the Chengdu Wings-- it's a not everyday you get to have these dishes all on table, and being the experimenter I am-- I had to make a mini wrap and have the fusion of different cultures in one bite. The ambience is travel themed: from the ticket menus to receiving your receipt in a book, the details are prevalent in their food and all around the space. Thank you, Nue!\", 'Wanted to try this place for their experimental fusion menu. We ordered the Syrian Kale Salad, African Bunny Chow, The Sichuan Thai Chicken, and Fries. The salad was incredible; it was packed with so much flavor and had a variety of nuts and spices tossed together. The chicken was hot, crispy, and spicy-- \\xa0would recommend. Wish we had more chicken because there were only 7 pieces. The chow chow was good but it wasn\\'t \"wow\" I\\'d order it again. Overall my experience here was great! It is on the pricier end so it wasn\\'t enough to fill me up but I would come back again and maybe try some other dishes. It is also a tiny restaurant with not a lot of space so try to reserve early!', \"Made reservations and got seats here around dinner as it's a pretty small restaurant and you could be waiting outside otherwise! We ordered he pineapple cornbread, south African bunny chow, chengdu spicy jumbo chicken wings, Trinidad doubles and he maracas shake and bake.Starting with my favorites, I really liked the maracas shake and bake which had a really nice flaky crispy flat bread which just melts in your mouth as you bite into it. Probably one of the most well made pastries which paired well with the soft cod inside. The next were the Chengdu spicy jumbo chicken wings. These were some massive chicken wings and you could really tell there was that Asian flavor and spice in there which I assume are the birds eye chilies commonly found in Asian cuisine.Next up was the South African Bunny Chow which was unique in it's own standing as a tomato based curry with chicken in a piece of cut out toast. The chicken was tender and the curry were good, but nothing quite stood out to me in terms of flavor. The toast was also a plain loaf. The Trinidad doubles was a little more interesting as it used a Trinidad hot sauce in the chutney which I found to be very spicy, but that's to be expected. The flatbread that it came on was hard and difficult to chew through though.Last, but not least we had the pineapple cornbread which was topped off with coconut flakes. The cornbread was enjoyable as It was slightly sweet, soft and moist enough. Overall, I really enjoyed the variety of different cuisines from various cultures and the creativity. However, the flavors were just lacking in some areas and nothing really stood out as amazing, taste wise for me. I would definitely come back to try out some of the other dishes and give it another chance.\", \"Nue was a cool vibe where you can find a great variety of foods in a super chill ambiance that has a cool backdrop of decor. We were seated pretty quickly as fortunately there was an empty table. Pineapple Cornbread - a fun take on cornbread as you get the texture of cornbread with a hint of sweetnessChengdu Spicy Jumbo Chicken Wings - good sauce and well-battered wings. \\xa0The fish sauce flavor is potent but still delicious. Gujarati Style Brussels Sprouts - some really good tasting brussel sprouts as it doesn't hurt that it's friedA fun time with tasty foods. The presentation of the main entrees is great as well.\", \"A really cute restaurant with a wide array of cultural influences. Everything about this restaurant is so creative and unique. The cocktails were pretty yummy and not weak at all!The Chengdu wing tower was a really cool concept and isn't too spicy as long as you don't eat any of the red peppers (which are pretty spicy if you do eat it). They were also very juicy and crispy.The Bunny chow was also very yummy and fragrant. I will say I didn't expect the bread bowl to be the type of bread that is white sliced bread. I think it was a little too absorbent and sweet so I would prefer the typical chewy/crispy bread bowl texture.The fries were amazingly crispy and fresh! I normally prefer thinner fries, but these were so fluffy they definitely exceeded my expectations. The garlic mayonnaise it comes with is also really savory and tasty. It also comes with peanut sauce which I didn't really enjoy and did not eat any of.Our waitress was also very nice and the food came very quickly. A super great place to try!\", \"Amending my previous review to disclaim that I'm picker about my eggs than anyone has a right to be! \\xa0And I'm STILL thinking about that Shakshuka.\", 'The Israeli Shakshuka might be my favorite thing I\\'ve ordered in the last few months. Super rich, spicy, but a tangy bite from the Zhug (\"chili pepper stuff\") on top, it was perfection in a tiny wok. Filipino Tosilog was also enjoyable (think Filipino bacon) if only I hadn\\'t had the Shakshuka first. Ditto with the Sunny Bunny - almost like a chicken curry bread bowl. The Tidy Sanchez (tequila, grapefruit & bitters) is my new favorite brunch drink. My only criticism is that the eggs that were on every dish were sunny, kinda runny (not enough), but oddly rubbery. Like they were pre-cooked and just hanging out to be added to the dishes. It would make sense - at 11:30 on a Saturday business was brisk. Service was excellent and food arrived quickly. And I\\'d still go back for that Shakshuka.', 'Amazing food!!We stumbled onto this spot and boy are we happy about it. Their food is simply amazing. Meme tried the brusselnspouts, tocino and the cornbread. Everything was delicious. Must try.', \"Suchaa cute concept of trying different flavors from different parts of the world!! Balinese spare ribs so tender) and the South African bunny chow were my favorites! Chengdu chicken and Burmese salad were also solid. Price point: ended up to be about $26 per person after tax and tip, and I personally was satiated but not stuffed. Dishes do seem to run pricier but makes sense given the variety of dishes they prepare! Overall cool place; service could be better tho because they didn't seem very attentive.\", 'Our first time at NUE and it did not disappoint. Their menu is a passport to different flavors. I smiled the moment I saw Tocilog on their menu. Of course I had to order it. Their Filipino Tocilog even came with the savory dipping sauce. The slices of tocino were tender and the egg was perfectly fried to a crisp. The Israeli Shakshuka was perfectly cooked and well-seasoned. Finally, the Tower of Chengdu Wings had a nice crunch and spice. I can definitely taste the delicious and familiar flavor of fish sauce, lime, and peppercorn. The presentation was impressive. This was all consumed and chased down with a glass of \"Less Mosa.\"Their space is rather cozy and eclectic and the service was excellent. I would absolutely save this restaurant as another brunch/dinner spot to consider when in Capitol Hill.', \"Stopped by for brunch, I've heard many great things throughout the recent months. Solid, above average dining but I wasn't completely blown away. I'd like to try the menu for dinner as well, it might raise this to a 5. Food was excellent but some were top tier whereas others felt slightly above average. Bottomless Mo Mosa was alright. It's what you expect I guess, nothing really special about it.Dutch Patat Oorlog (War Chips) were good, but fairly small for the price point. A tasty appetizer, but not my most reliable item here. Slightly hot and spicy but not too much, but beware.The star of the show was the Filipino Tosilog, the pork was amazing. Think char siu or barbecue pork but much more tender and juicier. I'd order the meat alone if I could, it was extremely impressive and I'd give it a 5 however other items balance the rating to a 4.South African Sunny Bunny was very unique as a bread bowl dish. It was more like half a loaf of bread (square-ish) with fillings on top and slightly inside. This dish would've been way more enjoyable with rice, but then again my friends and I are likely biased in our liking of rice. The bread simply wasn't it for us.Fried chicken wings were marinated in a soy garlic sauce which weren't too unique. However, the wings had a great texture and crispness which made them one of the best I've had. If there were multiple sauce options or even dry rub options, I'd be inclined to visit more often.\", 'Wings were so flavorful, loved the Thai chillis. The spare ribs are another thing worth ordering. The bunny chow was pretty good and different. It came out warm and not hot. Small spot, sat by the window. Nice interior.', \"Really cool variety in the menu and international decor! I only ordered the Dutch mini cake and mulled wine for myself, but both were delicious! My group of 4 joined the waitlist ~10 min before arrival, but had to wait a whole hour before being seated. The wait would be my only con, but I'll definitely try this place again at a different time! Would be a good date night spot. My only comment for improvement would be that the indoor table we were at was uncomfortably close to the next table over. Meaning lots of shifting when people got food and went to the bathroom etc.\", \"What a unique restaurant! Nue is definitely an eclectic restaurant that is unmatched in Seattle. The menu is so diverse and stems from the owners experiences around the world. The decor is pretty cool and the servers are really friendly. The restaurant itself is a little tight and if you're still uneasy about social distancing, you might as well get take-out or delivery.We got a bunch of dishes and shared everything. The Beirut style hummus, Balinese bbq spare ribs and Chengdu spicy jumbo chicken wings were delicious. The hummus came with warm pita bread which made a world of a difference. The hummus itself was fantastic and creamy. The bbq spare ribs were probably my favorite dish. It was sweet and tangy and the meat fell right off the bone! The chicken wings had a kick to it. The presentation is a spectacle and I would highly advise ordering it! We also got some other dishes that I thought were average: South African bunny chow, cubano sandwich, and pineapple cornbread. The bunny chow was something I have never tried before. Essentially, it's a curry dish but I thought the curry itself was mediocre. The cubano sandwich looks better than it tastes. The fries were pretty plain though. In all, this restaurant is definitely unique and you might get a kick out of the eclectic menu. It's definitely a place you should check out for the cool dishes!\", \"TL;DR: Cool vibe, sweet playlist, decent foodCame for an afternoon snack for 4 semi-hungry fattiesDrink: Nue Fashioned (4/5) - strong but a little too sweetEat: - War chips (4/5) - fries with some toppings. Would've probably given the same rating without the toppings - Ribs (4/5) - way drier than expected. These were super smokey and our group agreed that while it was cooked to the point of fall-off-the-bone, the flavor and texture was more like beef Jersey - Chengdu Chicken wings (4/5) - good wings if you enjoy fish sauce; portion size was really good too \\xa0*pro tip: if you're sharing, or worried about spice level, definitely ask for the chilis on the side because they are HOT - Egyptian(I thinkBrussels sprouts (2/5): first off, we all love brussels sprouts. These looked so promising but the pomegranate molasses/syrup added is just way too much. We couldn't finish this :( - Hummus & Pita (4/5): Good flavor and consistency with the hummus and the pita was nice and fluffyOverall: we'll be back to kick it, grab some drinks, and to sample the rest of the menu next time keeping in mind that Nue's flavor profile tends to push sweeter than our palettes are used to.Keep up the fish sawwwwce - cheers, Nue!\", 'NUE is hands down the BEST restaurant in Seattle!!! It has been my favorite restaurant for years. The food is consistently delicious, worldly, and packed full of powerful flavor! They also offer gluten-free options, which is awesome!

A must try place!!', \"Nue checks all the boxes when it comes to a good brunch spot. Delicious food, innovative cocktails, friendly service, and a vibrant atmosphere.I was really excited to try out this place because of their eclectic menu with dishes inspired from different parts of the world.Came on a Saturday afternoon with our pups and sat on their patio. We ordered the Israeli shakshuka, Filipino tosilog, and the tower of chengdu wings to share. Everything was beyond amazing! I enjoyed the presentation of the wings and flavors were on point. They had a nice kick to them from the Thai chilis. The shakshuka was one of the best I've ever had! And you can't pass up on the tosilog - it was certainly hearty and filling.Highly recommend this restaurant if you're looking to try something different. Can't wait to come back and try their other selections!\", \"Great food and awesome decor! I ordered the South African Bunny Chow for weekend brunch and it was so delicious. It's a chicken curry dish in a bread bowl and topped with an egg. The bread was light and fluffy and perfectly complemented the flavorful curry. The interior is packed with fun and eclectic decor. There aren't a ton of seats so I would recommending putting your name on the Yelp waitlist before heading over. I will definitely be coming here again!\", 'I found Nue through Yelp and decided to try it out for my birthday. First it was really easy to get to and they have parking near by. Second the staff was very welcoming and attentive and very accommodating to my party since the numbers changed at the last minute. The drinks and food were so good. I love spicy foods so the wings were right up my alley. But be warned, the flavor combinations they have come up with will knock your socks off, lol.', 'We went for dinner and only handful of menu items and was a little disappointed .I took Cambodian eggplant curry and others roll French tacos and chicken wings and chicken sandwich .Chicken wings was not that great but wonderful presentation. Sandwich was so flavorful with chicken fried with Korean spices .Cambodian eggplant was bursting with flavors of lemon grass , fish sauce , Thai basil and cayenne pepper.', \"Went on a Friday night around 9:30 pm and we got seated instantly. Cocktail menu is great! Food menu is creative as well. We ordered 5 things:Smoldering Paloma - pretty tasty. Goes well with what we orderedBelli Dancer - didn't try it but my friend loved it because she wanted something sweet. Burmese Laphet Thoke - tea leaf salad. A little non traditional with some purple cabbage. Too light on the oil and needed lemon juice so it was dry. But flavors were on point. My friends, who had never had tea leaf salad, really liked it. I've had some better ones in SF, but this dish is hard to find so I was pleased. Chengdu Spicy Jumbo Chicken Wings - very sticky and fish sauce flavored. Could have had more Mala flavor and crispy texture. I'd consider doing a dry rub instead of sauced. Presentation was awesome though. Balinese Barbecued Spare Ribs - savory and delicious Overall I'd come back because it's a solid spot for a date or with friends. Looking around at other's food revealed some more items I'd order. Thank you, Nue!\", \"This was a really cute dinner spot that served tapas sized food. We shared five dishes between the four of us and we were pretty satisfied afterwards! The ribs were the showstoppers of the evening, with the cornbread and kebab, and wings not falling too far behind. I would say their French something tacos were very meh, though I guess it was exactly how I should've expected it to taste - fries with meat and cheese in a burrito.They had a great selection of drinks and we all had an overall good experience!I would say I would give it a 4.5 just because the pricing of some of the items are a bit pricey for what it is.\", \"Im happy to see that Nue once again brought back the Peri Peri chicken sandwich. \\xa0Its not a fried chicken like before so it's probably healthier and definitely still delicious!

It was pretty packed (as expected) and had about a 45 min wait. The inside was so cute and cozy and the food was great! A super interesting menu and everything looked so good.We ordered the chicken and waffles and the sunny bunny. The chicken and waffles were really good, but a little heavy on the fish sauce flavor. The sunny bunny was so good! I've never had anything like it and really enjoyed it. My boyfriend and I split both of these meals and left stuffed. Would definitely come again!\", 'Although our order got lost somewhere between the counter and the kitchen once we got our food we were happy. \\xa0 Huge portions for a great price and really yummy fresh pasta.', \"I feel very bad for giving this restaurant a poor review but I had a very frustrating experience here.My husband and I decided to dine-in for brunch on Wednesday morning at about 11:30am. We were seated right away but that's about it when it comes to quick (or even appropriate) service. It took our sever over 15 minutes to come take our order. We understand that the restaurant was busy, with 3 other parties dining in...but we felt like we were being passed up every time. Which is funny considering we sat right by the register and the sever passed us every 2 mins. We waited 42 minutes to receive our dishes. I kept count the entire time we waited and it was very frustrating. The food was good but I am not sure it was worth it. The chicken and waffles were delicious. The chicken wings had a nice crunch and the sauce was sticky and yummy. I would have preferred to have more sauce though, and the chicken was a bit dry. My husband had the Filipino breakfast and he felt right at home. The portion was huge and plentiful. However, the sauce that was served with his meal was a bit strange. I think the lack of service had to do with the one server and two cooks. It also seemed like they were giving online orders priority. I can understand wanting to execute the orders in order and clear out their list but when you have 2 people dining in and sitting right in front of the kitchen, I do not think it is ok. I feel like they need a better system. We literally waited 42 minutes for two dishes. Ridiculous.\", \"A unique menu that presents street food from around the world at a premium. We ordered the chicken which tasted deflated like they were just sitting on a counter for hours and the infamous Giant Thai Water Beetle! It tasted SUPER salty, and for that cockroach to be $8 I'd expect it to at least have meat in its bones, but alas it was all skin and salt.Its not a place for a sustaining meal but maybe for a silly goofy night with friends grabbing a light snack. Even then, the food came out lukewarm. :(I also saw the waitress cry and storm out after an interaction with another staff member which really cemented my decision that this was a one and done place.\", \"I really like the atmosphere, the music, the relaxed vibe, service, and ofcourse the food. I came with my sister around 1130am and we ordered the cornbread, shakshouka, waffle with fries and hummus. Everything was well seasoned and flavored. I loved sitting by the window counter facing the street while we waited.  \\xa0I really like this restaurant and I'm so glad we came here. I don't know how authentic the food is because my experience with different cuisines is minimal but the shakshouka alone was perfection. There was a green spicy topping and it blended so well with the tomato base and runny egg yolk making it more mellow. My waffles and fried chicken were also on another level. It was slightly salty but tangy and there was also red chile peppers for some heat.  \\xa0TL;DR just check this place out and eat here...period\", \"It's an okay place. Got the Cambodian curry, the rice was eh, could have been fresher and softer. The food was alright, but for the price wasn't really worth it for the portion size either.\", \"While Nue is a fun place that has an international vibe, the actual execution is underwhelming. For $178 (including a 20% tip) we got 2 bugs, a salad, chicken wings, and a few cocktails. If they had all been spectacular then this ticket would have made sense. Given that my friend is from Vietnam and I lived in Thailand, we have a decent understanding of what the cuisine from the area should be: a punch of spicy, tangy, salty, and sweet. However, most everything was on the bland side. Some of the cocktails were adequate. Unfortunately, my friend couldn't even drink the Rưou Rắn Cobra, which tasted more like straight liquor than a cocktail. The place has potential, but they seem to be getting by with that alone. Not sure how sustainable that approach will be.\", 'Really loved the bunny chow, the tea salad, the carrot salad and the chengdu chicken wings are a must. Loved that we could just go to one place and try all the global street food. One suggestion would be to add some good street satay - from Malaysia or Singapore. Overall it is an eclectic experience in a cozy atmosphere.', \"Flew into Seattle late at night and this is one of the few places that we're open. Located in the heart of Capitol Hill this is the perfect late night snack. My bf and I got the South African bunny chow and chengdu spicy jumbo wings. I think the South African bunny chow was delicious and we could've done without the bread and preferred To have it over rice but I know that this place is a fusion of different ethnic foods and they give their own twist on it which I can appreciate. The chengdu spicy jumbo wings were absolutely delicious and my favorite food that I got. It's the perfect mix of spice, sweet, sour and tangy. It also had a great crunch to it. This place is eclectic adorned with different Knick knacks from all over the world. I love how their menu is like a boarding pass and give you wanderlust.

I like that they have outdoor seating now as there are only s few seats inside. Definitely make a reservation if you plan on going!', \"We've been wanting to come up to Seattle to try Nue and made it happen for our anniversary lunch. We started with the War Chips (Dutch Patat Oorlog) followed by a Croatian Cevapi and Nepali Aloo Ko Achar. The War Chips are a great starter/share plate. Crispy fries with onions and sauces that make a flavorful combination. The Nepali Aloo is a cold potato salad of Nepalese seasoning with tomato chutney and the Croatian sandwich is a pita stuffed with sausage, onion, cream, and ajvar. Both dishes were very flavorful and a great lunch size. The sausages were very, very good. Service was friendly and fast. Food delivery was also quick. This is a great place to stop and we'll be back.\", \"I went with 3 other friends because the food looked interesting. The last time I tried during restaurant week, they were closed due to staffing issues so I was excited to try it. Together we family styled the South African Bunny, The Chengdu chicken with waffles and Shakshuka. The Chengdu Chicken and waffles came out first. I found that it wasn't as crispy as I had hoped. It wasn't bad but it wasn't mindblowing. It was interesting though because the syrup to go with the waffles seemed a bit spicy. The South African Bunny reminded me of brick toast but savory. It did enjoy it the best. It's a curry flavor and while I was fine with the bread, some of my friends said they would have preferred it with rice.The Shakshuka was alright. There was a lot of bell pepper and tomato and just a singular egg. I don't have much to say about it because it didn't really stand out to me compared to the other two dishes. Overall everything is on the slightly more expensive side while not mind blowing. It's interesting but it's not something I would go out of my way to go again, especially since the parking in the area is awful.\", \"Came during happy hour on a Wednesday with a friend and it was not too busy, we got seated right away. Right off the bat, I was super impressed with the aesthetic & decor of the place - super unique and it felt like I had stepped into a different country entirely! We ordered the Chengdu Spicy Jumbo Chicken Wings and they were DELICIOUS. 10/10. Big enough for the two of us to share as a snack. We saw an ad for Mangdana (Giant Thai Water Beetle) infused vodka on our table and asked our waiter about it out of curiosity, and he let us both take a sip of it for free to try it. It was actually super good and I had never tried anything like it before! They have a cocktail on their menu called Beetle Juice with Mangdana if you're interested in trying this. I personally haven't tried the Beetle Juice cocktail, but would try the next time I visit!\", \"The Chengdu wings are a must! Nue is such a unique restaurant that takes different cuisines and puts a twist on it. Make sure you join the wait list early this is quite a busy spot. There is heated patio dining which helps you get seated quicker. Everything we ordered was delicious and slightly different. If you're looking to try something new, try Nue!\", \"a very hot store In capitol hill, are always lots of peopleEnvironment: special features, very much like, the global collection of things from various places to bring the mix and match styleService: great waiter, very enthusiastic and nice, introduced their siganturesTaste: to be honest, there is nothing particularly good in Seattle, this restaurant is belong the upper levelwarchip-sauce is very rich fries, we all feel goodsouth African curry - bread and curry with beef, but personally I prefer Japanese curry or Thai curry with coconut milkchengdu chicken wings - not much to do with Chengdu, very un-Chinese fried chicken wings, feel like Korean practice, seasoning like asian fusionribs - this is a little expensive, but the meat baked very crispy and soft, sweet sauce, eat a piece of feel goodcorn bread-Personally, I like it, it's a creative dessert with corn flavor and not very sweetcream beer-Two men ordered it, they didn't expect there would be sugar and cream on top of the beer after they came up lol\", \"Saw \\xa0good reviews on Yelp about this place and decided to go there. Being a good blogger I feel it's my duty to provide legit reviews for any places I visit so it is going to be lengthy I suggest you to read till the end --- \\xa01. Disappointed- I loved the décor. But it was too hot in there. We were asked to sit on common table beside bar and literally sweating . I requested the head waitress there to let us sit on separate table (though the table was for 4 and we were 2 people and nobody was coming in the restaurant) she denied the request, just to see that later other waiter allowed 2 guys to sit on that table! Totally disappointed!2. Disappointed- Now talking about the food, we ordered the famous Chengdu Spicy Jumbo chicken wings and trust me totally disappointed. Very greasy/oily .. Some flavor on the out part of the fried wings was totally numbing our throats and had to eat the meat only. Didn't like it at all. Then we ordered frigget fries and again oily. As mentioned in their menu, if you are looking for most unhealthiest food, do visit Neu.3. Cocktails - Ordered Butterfly atomic Spritz and Kala Manasuna, +1 to bartender for making the visit worthy! Good amount of alcohol in the cocktails. Loved it. Also the tall waiter was handsome and sweet :)\", 'Great place! Went back home to visit for thanksgiving this past year, and was so grateful \\xa0of how convenient it was to make reservations (through Yelp). You absolutely have to have their fried rice. I am Filipino myself, and their fried rice is amazing.', 'Such a fun spot with tasty food! We had a team lunch here a few weeks ago and had a great time. The pineapple coconut cornbread is a must. Perfect for sharing, and sweet enough to have for dessert. The hummus is goood - perfect texture and flavor. Several of us had the shakshuka and just loved it. It was nicely flavor and cooked well.', \"Came across during one of our nights in Seattle that opened late nights. Couldn't find street parking but there's a pay parking garage right next to the building. They offer both indoor and outdoor seating but we opt for inside since it was a chilly night. The inside of the restaurant smelled amazing and the ambiance was great and servers were somewhat attentive.We came on a Saturday night around 9pm, so it wasn't exactly busy but they may have been short on staff? We ordered a lot of food because we wanted to try everything and it took a while for the food to come out. We weren't mind-blown. I believe the chefs were banging out all the orders per table because we got all our food altogether but a lot of the food felt like it was sitting?Chengdu Spicy Jumbo Chicken Wings (3.5/5) - Flavors were good but it came out cold. It definitely had a nice kick and remind me of the nuoc man wings from Pok PokBurmese Laphet Thoke (tea leaf salad) (4/5) - This was probably the only dish we thought was good, though it was less citrusy than the usual tea leaf I've had. There was A LOT of chewing from all the nuts and peas. Prepare for a sore jaw.Roti (3.5/5) - Sauce was good, but roti is roti.Pineapple Cornbread (3.5/5) - It was really dry, you need to smash it down and mix it with the coconut for it to taste a bit moist.Gujarati Style Brussels Sprouts (3/5) - It came out cold as well and the inside was not cooked through so it was still hard. Pomme Frites (3.5/5) - Nothing special, just fries with sauces. It was great to get a taste of food that reminds me of my Asia trips but the food was okay.\", \"I'm leaving this review hoping that it will reach a manager. We are long time patrons and HUGE fans of Nue. Normally, the food and drinks are absolutely delicious. We've come to Nue over 50 times and always order the same dishes. I tell all my friends and family to come here. Today, at 1pm Sunday, we came in for brunch, ordered around 5 dishes and 2 bloody Mary's and everything was extremely underwhelming and completely different from the normal quality. This was by far the worst meal we've ever had there and it was very concerning since we love Nue and wanting to keep coming back. The hummus was extremely under seasoned with a very dry texture without the usual spices and oil. The squash curry was also under seasoned and bland without any of its usual complexity. It tasted very thrown together and was also a lot spicier than usual, which didn't make up for the lacking overall flavor. The bloody Mary's tasted like sriracha and vodka in a cup. Normally I LOVE the Nue bloody Mary's. Everything else - Brussels spouts and kale salad- was less well cooked or seasoned than usual. Overall, it was an extremely underwhelming meal. This was disappointing and we hope the managers / owners can get to the bottom of it! If the chef / manager sees it, respond or reach out to me and I am happy to take it down. I am only leaving this review to hopefully reach the right eyes!\", 'I absolutely LOVE nue- especially for their vegan options! Amazing fries, Brussels sprouts, hummus, kale salad and bean dishes. Cocktails are also delicious. Highly recommend and hope they add even more vegan dishes soon', \"It's a travel around the world in one sitting. Definitely worth the wait if there's a line.\", \"The theme of this restaurant is spot on!! Their international cuisine is so creative and flavorful. Everything from the decor to the bill that's served in a travel guide is so carefully themed! I personally loved their crispy brussel sprouts and South African bunny chow. Their pineapple cornbread was tasty, but not life changing in my opinion. Would I come back? Yes! I'm curious to check out their other menu options :)\", \"A eclectic restaurant is a gem in Seattle. They have food from all over the world and even some wacky Thai Water Beetles! Not for me but my friends have them a try and stated they were simply salty. The cocktails weren't that great: the food the strong-suite of this place in my opinion. I couldn't really taste the lime or star anise in my drink, it was just like spiked pineapple juice.\", \"Unfortunately, underwhelming and overpriced. Probably won't return and can't recommend it.The tosilog was the best out of the three dishes we tried. The beef tocino was sweet and not overcooked and paired well with the garlic rice and sweet dipping sauce. Overall, a straightforward dish and pretty good.The chicken and waffles were alright but personally I think they used too much fish sauce. I use fish sauce all the time at home, and every time I took a bite, all I could think about was how fishy it tasted. The chicken was breaded and crispy and the chilis were spicy but I'd rather they have fish sauce wings that aren't breaded or chicken and waffles without fish sauce.The lentils were pretty bland. Curries/lentils are the perfect vehicle for butter/fat, salt, msg, etc. and as a restaurant they have a license to use as much as possible so for it to be weak/bland was disappointing.For 3 items w/o drinks, w/tax, and w/tip the bill was $70+ which was steep for me given that we could only recommend 1/3 dishes. Overall, this place missed the mark for me on both quality and value.\", \"Honestly my go-to date spot or a place to recommend to out of towners. You'll always find new items on the menu from around the world from appetizers, entrees, to drinks. I love their Chengdu wings that's a little spicy, a little sweet, savory, and tasty in between. All their drinks are delicious and definitely don't sleep on the Beetle Juice. Disgusting as it sounds, it's very refreshing and has a light flavor. What I like best is the origin story of the owners who found that this shop gives them a lot of meaning. If there's an argument of appropriation and appreciation, they definitely have the respect due to each dish. PLUS, they pay their workers well and have keen covid policies. Sometimes, food and profits go towards those in needs around Seattle. Happy to put money where it matters and it's definitely towards Nue.\", \"Daily happy hour ftw!! Don't sleep on this deal! A generous selection of food and drinks are $2 off daily from 3-6pm (as of the posting of this review). The Chengdu spicy jumbo chicken wings are a must. Juicy, tender meat and great kick of heat. They're double dipped, fried with szechuan peppercorn, fish sauce, thai chili, and basil, and then stacked to perfection. How could I say no? If you're looking for additional heat, eat a chili or two off the plate. ;) The smoldering paloma is definitely smoldering for those who like a spicy alcoholic beverage. You can ask for non-smoldering if preferred. Delicious accompaniment to my wings (although perhaps spicy on spicy wasn't my best decision to date lol). -1 star for being forgotten for most of my time there while the couple next to me was checked in on regularly. I came alone and was seated next to the front door, so maybe easily overlooked. Regardless, I do recommend the wings! $28 for wings and drink before tax.\", \"Wow I'm not usually one for Asian fusion but this place does it well! Knocked off a star because it is kind of pricey for what it is.I came here with a friend to try their brunch. We ordered the chengdu chicken and waffles and Filipino tosilog to share.Chengdu chicken and waffles 4.5/5- I'm not a huge chicken wing fan but this was pretty good and juicy!! I loved the spicy kick to it (you may not want to order this if you can't handle spice though)Filipino tosilog 5/5- this was pretty solid and I liked the garlic rice that came w it. My favorite Filipino breakfast place closed down a few years ago so I hadn't had anything like it in a while. This was a nice throwback!The inside is pretty interesting- has a bunch of random stuff on the wall ranging from different alcohol bottles to dolls haha.I definitely want to come back to try their dinner menu!! I've heard only great things!\", \"One of the best meals I've had since moving to Seattle. Wings were fantastic- spicy and sweet and just so so good. Next up was the Maracas shark and bake- also amazing. The bread/ wrap was a wonderful texture, and the filling was top notch. Final dish was the South African bunny chow- incredible. We finished with the South African chocolate cake- one of the best desserts I've ever had. Absolutely will be back!The only thing that didn't completely knock it out of the park for me was the Korean cream beer. It was just a light tasting beer with literal whip cream on top that was supposed to be drank with a straw. I couldn't \\xa0figure out how one was supposed to enhance the other, because when you mixed them it just caused the beer to foam over. So I ate whip cream off the top, then drank my beer. Would pass on that next time\\u200d\", \"I'll always remember Nue as the restaurant that has a water beetle dish on their dinner menu. This is not because I've had the water beetles before (I'm not that adventurous haha), but because I respect Nue's creativity and commitment to authenticity in having that dish.What I did try was the Filipino Tosilog which was a nice barbecue pork along with garlic + scallion fried rice + two eggs. They also are served with a soy and chili vinegar which I enjoyed dipping everything into. I wouldn't say the fried rice or the eggs were particularly memorable but the pork was delicious (I do enjoy the burnt parts of the pork), and overall I feel like this is a safe dish to order.I also sampled the South African sunny bunny which is basically Indian curry over soft bread topped with a fried egg. I tend to enjoy more creamy curries over rice, but this dish was a nice change of pace.Overall I wouldn't say I was blown away by anything I tried, but I love Nue's combination of brunch and tapas and would love to try some of their other dishes in the future.\", 'The food had a lot of flavor, however the cuts of chicken for the chengdu chicken and waffles were extremely lean. It was barely substantial for the amount charged.', 'I didn\\'t try the Chengdu chicken wings but I am still happily leaving a 5-star review!We dropped by on a Sunday around 5:30 and luckily were able to get a table for 3 inside. The indoor seating is super fun because of all the decorations to look at. One of the walls has a bunch of shelves crowded with trinkets and various bottles of alcohol. The shelves continue to the back wall, where you could almost miss the bar if you do not look carefully.We tried the limau asam boi ($6) which was a blend of calamansi, lemon and lime juice, and honey, decorated with a preserved plum. The drink was refreshingly tangy.The entrees here are not cheap (around $20-30), but we enjoyed all of them. We tried the Balinese sate lilet ($16), Trinidadian curried channa and aloo ($20), and the South African bunny chow ($20). We ended up sharing everything family-style because we wanted to try it all! The portion sizes were good especially since the bunny chow came in a thick bread bowl.My favorite dish was the curried channa and aloo (it\\'s vegan too!). The curry was full of flavor. The chickpeas and potatoes were soft but not mushy. I\\'d argue that the best part was the roti, which was super flaky and chewy.The bunny chow was super flavorful, too. The bread it came with was rich and buttery. My least favorite (this sounds misleading, because I still enjoyed it a lot) was the sate lilet. The fish was tender and sweet-- not in an \"added sugar\" way but in a natural way. I LOVED the sambal it came with, which was super flavorful and packed a spicy kick. The rice tasted good but was plain. If I had this dish by itself I would feel like it was missing something, but I got to enjoy the rice with the other dishes we got so everything worked out deliciously.At the end of the meal, the check came in a book! I loved the design concept of this restaurant and the food was great, too. Will have to come back for the wings next time.', 'Man definitely my top 3 places to brunch... this place has never disappointed me. Always 5 stars here. Staff is on specially how busy they get. Just writing this makes me want it again and again. Parking can be a lil tough. Leave a lil earlier specially if you have reservations here. The whole ambiance is dope. From the food to all the trinkets in this restaurant is a lot of history. Go here now.... Yum \\xa0love it here.', \"*Open for dine-in and takeout June 2021*Overall impression: street food from all over the world, mostly South East Asia. Some interesting flavor combos. A bit on the pricey side for the food and ambience - we sat in the outdoor patio on the side walk.Memorable dishes: *Tower of Chengdu Wings ($18 for 5 wings) - The chicken wings are well-fried. The sauce is a combination of sugar, fish sauce, lime, Thai chili, Sichuan peppercorn and basil. I liked it so much I tried to replicate it at home (and it was a success if you are wondering) *Eggplant Curry- I honestly can't remember what this dish is called. But one bite instantly took me back to the street of South East Asia (it must be the galangal). It's unique in flavor, but can use a little more salt.*Pineapple Cornbread - good side dish. A little sweet never hurts nobody. *Chocolate Malva - super chocolate-y cake with a hint of orange. Perfect way to wrap up the meal\", \"You have to got to get the Tower of Chengdu Wings if you're ever in Seattle! The flavors are out of this world, you can taste every single herb and spice that they've used in perfect harmony. The wings itself are so crunchy and the sauce is sticky and flavorful. It really is the best combination of wings I have ever tried. Fiancé ordered the Filipino Tosilog and as a Filipino, I approve of their version. The garlic fried rice, to the eggs and the tocino that they use - *chef's kiss*. The decor and ambiance makes it feel like a world market, they've really captured what each region of the world's specialty is and turned it into a restaurant. Highly recommend to check this place out. It's a unique experience. I still think about the wings and nothing has ever compared to it. Damn you NUE!\", \"Came here for Weekday lunch with friends. Got an outdoor table right away. They provided portable heaters so it remained warm. At my past visits here before the pandemic, I was always impressed by their food. This time I kept the same expectation but got disappointed. The Filipino Tosilog I ordered from the weekday brunch menu was at best average. I usually enjoy meat with sweet seasoning, but the cured pork in this dish was definitely over-sweetened. Some grilled edge of the pork pieces tasted bitter. The pork itself didn't have any taste other than the seasoning. The rice and the sunny side up were delicious, on the other hand.It was also concerning to me that I got a cup with a big visible lip mark on it...\", \"*** 4.5 stars ***We were here right in time for their daily happy hour (3-6pm).For a party of four, we shared a house-made pineapple cornbread ($4), a small war chips ($4), an Irish spice bag ($10), a Chengdu spicy jumbo chicken wings ($15), an East Indies Brussels sprouts ($9), and two world skewers ($9 total). They were all from the Happy Hour menu Everything was delicious! \\xa0My absolute favorite is the chicken wings. It's not even close to the authentic Sichuan food (Chengdu is the capital city of Sichuan), but the fusion was perfect. The wings were crispy, tender, juicy, and greatly seasoned at the same time. My second favorites are the Brussels sprouts and the pineapple cornbread. The dipping sauces and the toppings (coconut & garlic chutney) of the Brussels sprouts were definitely the crowning touch! The cornbread had minimum pineapple scent but was still delicious.I enjoyed all the other dishes as well. The only thing got me confused was the Irish spice bag. According to the menu it was supposed to be primarily chicken tenders, Butler than half of the bag was filled with extremely crispy (breakable) French fries? Hmmm... The skewers were good but definitely overpriced at $4.5 each.My friends each ordered an alcohol drink, two from the HH menu and one cocktail. Our total came out to be $77 not including tax/tips. Overall we had a pleasingly delicious dinner here! I can see some dishes being overpriced on the regular menu, but they do offer great deals during HH! A great spot for delicious fusion food, with a quite reasonable price given its location. I'd love to visit again.\", \"We came on a Friday afternoon for lunch and they were able to seat us right away. We ordered the fries, brussel sprouts, and African sunny bunny chow. The fries had multiple flavors with the different sauces that were on it and the purple onions added a bit of crunch to it. The brussel sprouts were cooked very well; they were very crunchy and the balsamic glaze and hummus took this dish to another level. I never knew that brussel sprouts could taste like that! The sunny bunny chow was also amazing! We split it between 2 ppl and asked for a rice instead of the bread bowl so they put the meal into two plates. The 2 plates were still really big so really happy we split it. Overall, really enjoyed all of the dishes that we went with! I've never tasted these type of flavors before and am really amazed at how different cultures make food taste.The waitress was super sweet and friendly. She came by the table multiple times to see if we were doing okay and to fill up on water.Would definitely recommend going to Nue! Their lunch and brunch menus are limited so would def have to come back for dinner to try more of their dishes out!\", \"Came for a lunch on Wednesday afternoon. The place was about 90% full, no wait. Located in Cap Hill, we were able tk find parking off the street easily at this time.It took a second to get our order in, there was one server who kind of controlled the whole floor. He had a pen hanging in both ears, which makes me think he's the boss-boss. But he was nice and the food came out at reasonable time once the order got in. The menu is a world good tour. Different dishes from different cuisines from top to bottom. The interior is decorated with various art, memorabilia, and Knickknack from all parts of the world. Loved this! Found myself entertained just by looking around.We had the bread bowl full of curry and the Chengdu tower of wings. Also a couple a bloody Mary's to start. Everything was great. The curry I was actually a big fan of, I love that style of curry and the bread went well with it(although in a rice guy). The wings were staked on kabob sticks. There was a bit of a numbing taste and it had some spice. I'd say 3.5/5 stars spicy. The BM's were had a bold flavor but they were really refreshing like that!I'd definitely come back again. Fun place to dine with a friend. The Instagram factor is strong with this one as well\", \"Want to eat around the world but only go to one destination? Then Nue is the place for you. The menu \\xa0takes your taste buds to Myanmar, South Africa, the Philippines and much more. We opted for out door seating to enjoy the Seattle summer but inside is very eclectic, cute, and cozy. Arrived for brunch but can't wait to try their weekday dinner menu. We ordered the Syrian Kale & Carrot Salad, Dutch Patat Oorlog (War Chips), Filipino Tosilog, Pineapple Cornbread, Less Mosa (creative name for single serving of the Mo' Mosa, which is a 32oz pitcher of mimosa). The flavors were absolutely delicious. The dates in the kale salad was a pleasant sweet surprise. I cannot wait to return for dinner.\", \"The food was really great and the over all experience was really fun! If you're used to Asian food maybe skip the chicken wing because it's likely you've already had it somewhere else, but the bunny toast thing was delicious!\", \"I love the diversity of foods on the menu. The tosilog and the shakshuka were so good! Your receipt is brought to you in traveling books. Found that cool too. It sucks that they no longer do bottomless brunch. I personally don't like how the OJ is pre-mixed in the champagne. However, the experience was still great.\", \"I never had such bad service. They think the food is so good that they can give terrible service. \\xa0The food was decent at best.The server didn't tell us anything about the menu, You would think a place that gives you a bite of different countries would provide recommendations. \\xa0Another thing is, we came in eating family-style and almost didn't. If we didn't do family-style, we would all take turns to watching each other eat. On another note, trying new dishes, you would think we would get new plates for new words. Seriously food was alright, but I can't get over how bad the service is. The bill was $200. I had better service at a fast-food joint. I used to recommend this place to new people all the time. Not coming back.\", \"I just love how everything is so funky at this place. Best to pair interesting cocktails and unusual snacks with your bravest companions. While the goat stew seemed to have fallen off the menu from a few years ago that was absolute divine, there were other snacks that just hit the spot like the chengdu chicken wings and Brussels sprouts. Do try the Thai Mang Da Na (aka Thai water beetle) - you won't regret it! Tastes like a sour watermelon jolly rancher. Love the clever names in their cocktails - make sure you go in with an open mind and enjoy all their offerings!\", \"Great neighborhood spot for lunch with friends! Had a delicious selection of goodies and Mo'mosa to share! Service was nice and the outdoor seating was comfortable. I'd recommend the shakshuka, the chicken and waffles, and the Brussels sprouts. The Vietnamese iced coffee was also decent!\", 'I recently dined here in\\xa0this restaurant for breakfast and tried the Fried Chicken and Chengdu Chicken & Waffles. I felt very satisfied and full after eating it. The food is incredibly nice and excellent. The topping sauce has a delicious flavor. a generous serving of food.The restaurant is fantastic, and the design is stunning. Inside was welcoming, and lighting was excellent. Intimate and comfortable. The service was excellent. I would probably come here for brunch and breakfast.', 'Oh wow! So for years I always wanted to come to this restaurant and I was finally here. Street parking is available and there is also outside seating. We sat inside where the decor was just everywhere. I meant decorations that was from around the world but not consistent. The food that was ordered did take a long time, but there was just one cook. The food was all tasty. Dishes from around the world. I would definitely return.', \"A fun global concept in a small eclectic space. While all tables were full when we arrived just a few minutes after there opening at 10am, we were able to sit outside at the little street bar, which worked out with the decent weather that day. We enjoyed creamy Vietnamese coffees and watching people pass by on the street while we looked over the collection of global eats offered on the menu. We started with a couple loafs of their coconut cornbread. The coconut flavor was unique and came through well, though the loaf itself was a bit greasy. I had the shakshuka, which was decent. The flavors were a bit underdeveloped and the consistency was a bit watery, but it was tasty nonetheless. My partner had the chicken and waffles, which was very tasty with a sort of savory waffle component and Szechuan spiced chicken. There were pockets of serious spice though, so be prepared! Service was on the slow side, which we didn't mind as we were catching up with a friend. Prices were on the high side, but probably not uncommon nowadays, especially in cap hill. Overall, a fun stop with a unique global menu.\", \"Nue is a SUPER awesome brunch spot! I really loved coming here and it was super easy to make a reservation ahead of time. I really love the international vibes, the creative decorations, and the layout of the place :) Each menu on the item is inspired by a different country - for example, Vietnamese Coffee and Filipino Tosilog are items on the menu. I ordered an Israeli Shakshuka and split with a friend, and it was absolutely wonderful. It tasted so good and the eggs were cooked to perfection! The dish was pretty big, so it was a great idea to split - however, if you're hungry, you could definitely finish this by yourself. I think most brunch places are overrated but Nue does brunch wonderfully and I can't wait to come back.\", \"Came to Nue on a Friday night and was expecting to wait a while in a line and surprisingly the wait time was less than 5 mins! The menu is amazing there are so many different types of food from different cultures, which made it extremely hard to choose a dish. I picked the Chengdu Spicy Jumbo Chicken Wings ($19), The roti ($5) and the frittes ($7). We loved the chicken wings, incredible presentation and they were very crispy and juicy on the inside. They definitely have a kick of spice which I loved but if you don't like spice, be wary. This is also a very filling entree and was nice to share along side other items. The roti was so hot and delicious, I wish there was some kind of sauce to dip them but they were still good without. The fries were good and the garlic dipping sauce was tasty however they were just regular fries so I am not sure they're worth $7... Service was friendly and their patio seating area was cute and comfortable.Tip- you can join the waitlist on yelp !\", 'Fantastic food-- highly recommend. Every dish we ordered-- be it the Shakshuka, Trinidadian Doubles, or, Dutch Patat Oorlog (the yummy French fries), were outstanding. I relished every single bite; it was a riot of flavors, but balanced together so beautifully well. The decor is very eclectic and if you love artsy stuff, then you could easily spend the entire time admiring the tchotchkes. Wait time was close to 40 minutes but so totally worth it. Would not hesitate to come back again!', \"Their chengdu spicy jumbo chicken is spicy as a mf but so good! But if you have a lower spice tolerance like me then Id be careful ordering it. South African bunny chow was like a curry in a cut out bread box(?) I wasn't 100% sure what I was eating but the flavor combo worked very well. Nue is a super cute, cozy and smaller sized restaurant and I heard they have bottomless mimosas(!!) will be back for that :)\", 'January 30: What an amazing treat after our day at Seward Park. The host was very gracious, and the food were as he described it - \"high end street food\", which is hard to do but Nue has pulled it off for sure! Case in point is the Chapli Kabab, something close to heart for any south Asian carnivore foodie. It is hard to keep it moist inside with crunch at first bite, like it was at Nue. The South African Bunny Chow, Egyptian Brussell Sprouts were my second favorites, and the chicken wings doesn\\'t deserve to be last by any other standards. As for drinks, the Sbiten...a mix between Mulled Wine and a Hot Toddy was amazing. And I forget what other drink we took. We\\'ll definitely be back. But it is pricey place and while the witty menu and warm service deserves so, we\\'ll be hard pressed to frequent this fine establishment.', \"Came in for Restaurant Week and it was a blast! Glad we made a reservation (on here) because it was packed. They also still checked vax cards.For a party of 2, we (over-)ordered the Caribbean Pineapple Cornbread, South African Bunny Chow, and Spanish Sabores Lemon/Olive Oil Cake from the Restaurant Week menu, as well as the French Tacos and Balinese Barbecued Spare Ribs from the main menu. We also each got the Limau Asam Boi (citrusy-sour plum drink), which I thought was really refreshing and tasty! I'd like to come back and try their cocktails next time!\", \"New to Seattle and have had a hard time finding a decent brunch spot! Bye was top notch! Service was great, food was incredible. Would definitely go again. We ordered a couple things to try on the menu and everything was so delicious. Highly recommend the wings! The spices were just right! The shakshuka was also very flavorful, didn't just taste like tomato sauce as I usually feel like it does. The rice along the pork for the Filipino Tosilog was cooked to perfection.\", 'The Filipino pork dish is world class. Vietnamese coffee right on the mark. Will be back!', 'This is the email you sent me after he read my review and my email he justified why his employee that Is one of the most trusted ones did what he did! No compensation for how we were mistreated without cause !!', \"I was super excited to try this place for the first time and meet my high school friend I have not seen twenty years ! She arrived first and put our names on the list I was running late coming from dress shopping and when I got to nue it was super busy and we reunited and started chatting as we waited for our table. We noticed people arriving and being seated right away like maybe 4 groups so we asked how far on the list until we are seated they said next we then waited and was catching on life. When it was returned a gentleman Sat Yes he had a beard and was heavier set he asked us if we didn't mind sitting by the bar on the tall chairs and that we did not mind at all I kindly asked him I see that you're busy and he said yes a lot of people had made reservations I said oh OK we've been waiting for like 30 minutes is there a good time where we should make reservations if we were ever to come again and he said yeah like an hour I said OKgood to know thank you. He asked us if he could get us anything else we asked if we could have two shots of tequila he said I'm not serving you you guys are intoxicated and I said excuse me I have not had one drink today she said you're slurring your words it was very you send it as I had just came from David's bridal And my friend had just gotten off work. I told him sir we just waited like 30 minutes he said no you waited 18 minutes I then told him thank you very much I hope he has a great day and that we will be taking your money somewhere else. We walked out and we walked down the street to this small little Italian place we had got seated and had no problem ordering any drinks or food I'm super disappointed in the service as I was excited to try this exciting new place with a friend I haven't seen in a long time the service was horrible and I felt uncomfortable! After that repair proceeded to the tin table And was greeted by the bar manager Lindsay and their staff was welcoming and lovely the kitchen was closing in like five minutes away still took our order of steak and lots of other items if I was intoxicated do you think two other bars would serve me??\", \"In a world chasing diversity in cultures this restaurant does it through their menu. If you love trying different cuisines' signature dishes in one location then this is the place to be. The place keeps rotating their menu with few mainstays in their offeringsI will have to concede that some dishes are mind blowingly good and others can be a good representation of what the dish should be but not quite there.Like their chengdu wings, pineapple corn breads,varying fusion of brussel sprouts are quite great in my opinion.However, the burmese laphet thoke (tea leaf salad) is not quite like it should be but a good candidate to give an idea about what the dish is.Similar opinion goes for south african Bunny chow or another trinidadian dish I had that I forgot the name of. I have not tried their beetles yet, maybe soon ,one day when i gather courage.Parking is bit bothersome around place because you are in capitol hill...but not too bad that you would give up.The place is quite small so the weekend crowds make the wait quite long and I have actually left when the queue did not move. I would recommend reservations.Service is good and I have never had any complaints in this regards as well\", \"I had read about Nue's chicken wings, so I knew I had to try them! I didn't look at the rest of the menu, so I didn't realize it was so culturally/globally diverse, and I loved that. I called the restaurant 3x to try and make a reservation, but didn't get a response. When we arrived, the wait was around 30 minutes. They were very busy and people just kept coming! My boyfriend and I shared the chengdu spicy chicken wings, frites with garlic mayo and the Portuguese peri peri chicken sandwich (I can't remember the exact name). There were other things on previous menus that looked great, but it is a seasonal/constantly changing menu. I also ordered their samgria, which I could have ordered 10 of, it was so refreshing and I loved the hint of guava. The wings were worth the wait. Super crispy/crunchy and flavorful! I am so thankful that the host/waiter (a soft spoken, younger, Asian gentleman) told me how hot the wings were because of the thai pepper and such. My spice tolerance decreased over the years, so even though I would want to try the wings as intended, my body definitely would have hated me. The chicken sandwich was also flavorful (and spicy) and the fries were so simple but deliciously crunchy.At first, I was a little upset because they didn't pick up the phone and I was pretty hungry, but once we were seated and had good conversation with the waiter, then everything was smooth sailing.\", \"Adventurous food from a self-described global street food eatery.Our group shared a little bit of nearly everything, including the Beirut style hummus, the Croatian cevapi, two orders of the Chengdu spicy jumbo chicken wings, the South African bunny chow, some roti, and a couple of deserts -- the Danish drommekage dream cake and the South African chocolate malva. Everyone liked the delicious Croatian sausage, which came in a pocket of flat bread, and we loved the creamy hummus. The chicken wings were quite spicy but also very wet and as a result not really crispy, maybe because our order was delivered. Interesting bunny chow, which is mainly a heap of curry on bread. We would have liked more curry, less bread. Tasty deserts.Yes, we'll be back for more.\", \"To be honest, we went here because everything else was super full for a party of 10 on Sunday. It was surprisingly interesting. It's definitely a fusion food place, so only try if you like flavorful foods and spice. I'm not giving it a full five star, because there were not any classic options for breakfast. But definitely worth a try if you're looking for something different. And the mimosas are well worth it! But they do come premixed.\", \"This is quite an eclectic restaurant! We walked in on a relatively busy Saturday and was lucky to get seated in the small indoor dining area where we can savor all the decoration around us while we enjoy the meal. There is a bunch of decor from around the world neatly placed, as well as a wide range of global inspired dishes to choose from. As we were not too hungry, we went with the highlights of this place that look quite unique in presentation: South African Bunny Chow, Chengdu Spicy Jumbo Chicken Wings, and Pineapple Cornbread.The South African bunny chow is curry with a block of bread; it's a little bit mushy if you wait too long to eat it, but otherwise, it's not quite spicy but it is super flavorful with a lot of spices. It kind of works, but it's not as good as I expected.The chicken wings were fantastic. It has a combination of saltiness, spiciness, and sweetness, and this works. There is a little bit of fish sauce as the base, with crispy chicken wings piled on top supported by some wooden sticks. Watch out for the red peppers, as they are numbing spicy! This is really good.Pineapple cornbread is also quite solid. I don't know honestly, but it works well - it is salty, sweet, and buttery. It really makes your tongue confusing. It's small for the price, but every bite is an experience.I really like the eclectic feel of this place, and the food somehow works for the most part. Their creativity to an extent makes this place fun and the food quite delicious in a different level.\", \"It's like a study abroad themed restaurant. \\xa0I actually wanted to dislike this place but the food is excellent. \\xa0I always get the Bunny Chow. \\xa0Its one of my favorite dishes anywhere in Seattle. Good drinks too.\", \"Walked in off the street on a Monday night on a co-worker's hunch and had a great experience. Fun attentive server who helped accommodate our vegetarian and guided our selections beautifully. Great mezcal cocktail but the standout for me was the fermented tea leaf salad in combination with the carrot kale salad. Yeah it's two salads. Deal with it. Brussels were great, too. Did not try the water beetles, but color me intrigued. 5 stars enthusiastically given!\", \"Egyptian style Brussels - perfectly crispy & crunchyIndonesian Roti - soft and subtle flavor, better to have with a saucy dishPineapple cornbread not too sweet and subtle soft crunch with the coconut topping. Not a coconut fan, but it tasted just fine with the pineapple yum!And the wings! Will have everyone at the table eating silently. \\xa0lolEverything was so delicious we devoured it. lol \\xa0 the decor is just as eclectic and entertaining. The music had a good playlist going too. \\xa0We're so happy we tried something new, couldn't have been better.\", \"Finally got to try the brunch here!! It's just as delicious as I remember! The pineapple cornbread is sweet and hearty, the shakshuka was spicy and savory, and the sunny bunny is still not made with actual rabbit but man it's good! Add a mimosa carafe and I'm good to go!\", \"If you haven't tried Nue yet, you're missing out! I'm still not 100% sure what kind of food it is, but I'm 100% sure I loved it! They have all kinds of street foods, which gives Nue a more casual feel, and most of the tables are long banquet-style seating so make some friends! My boyfriend and i each got drinks, I loved mine (something with bourbon and ginger and champagne) and he got the Lerma Drop which was SPICY!! He enjoyed it, but it's made with jalapeño tequila and seriously unless you want your lips burned off maybe think twice about ordering it. The waiter warned us that it was super spicy and he was right! For dinner we got the Brazilian Acaraje, which reminded me of a crab cake but with shrimp instead. It was delicious! We also shared the Bunny Chow which, contrary to the name, does not contain rabbit! It's more like a chicken curry in a bread bowl and holy cow it was amazing. The food is really unique so grab some friends, get some plates to share, and order the jalapeño drink at your own risk!\", \"Nue is a must try if you love chicken wings!! The chengdu chicken and waffles are packed with flavor. The wings have a nice fish sauce taste complemented with the pepper and thai chili kick. It is the perfect combination of savory, spicy, and sweet! The waffles weren't too sweet and went well with the chicken. Both the chicken and waffles weren't crispy as I would have liked but that's probably cause we got them to go. The South African bunny chow is also very flavorful with all of its spices. but a bit messy to eat. I will definitely come to Nue and eat at the restaurant to get the full experience!\", \"A solid 4 with some hits and some misses. GET THE RIBS. You won't regret it. It's a big pile of tender fall-off-the-bone pork ribs in a finger-licking-good sauce. The amount of meat on the ribs was insane. Best ribs I've had so far in my life. The South African bunny chow and Ghanaian red red with goat were also quite good -- I would definitely order them again. The mix of textures and flavor of the spices were excellent in both. The chengdu wings were pretty good but could've done with a little less sauce in my opinion to keep them crispier. The roti were disappointing and actually tasted like bitter burnt oil. Drinks - I liked the atlas shrubbed and the belli dancer. The Alonzo was a bit smaller than I expected for the price. The first time I came here the waiter seemed to be rushing us, which is one of my pet peeves. It seemed they were trying to clear the place out at 9:30 even though they were open till 10 (on a weeknight). The second time the service was good. I like how the restaurant has travel-themed details to match with their international cuisine!\", \"0 star if I could. One of our friends forgot her ID so she couldn't drink with us but we still went ahead and order drinks for us 2. Then the \\xa0friend that forgot her ID just took a sip out of the drink, mind you literally a sip! Then this waiter his name is GIL saw that, came over to our table so fast and aggressively snatched the drink out of my friends hand (the one has Id with her though) and took it away from us. The drinks were paid for and still full and he wouldn't let us 2 (the ones that have ID) finish them just because our friend who is again OLD ENOUGH but forgot her id to take a sip. Seriously you don't need to be that rude and unprofessional! So what if she took 1 sip out of drink is not like she's not old enough for you to take our drinks, the drinks that we already paid! Just because you have a bad day, don't put that on your customers!Response to the owner: hi Chris, understand your point, but as a GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE, Gil could have HANDLED BETTER by communicating with us. We could HAVE EVEN GONE home and get the ID if necessary . Took the drinks out of your customers' hands while they were drinking are rude no matter what! All of this could have been avoided if he could communicate with us. Honestly, we had no issue with him taking our drinks away, we are upset just how we were treated by Gil and his action was so aggressive that we felt violated and disrespected!\", 'This place is great to go with a few people as you can share everything and portions are big.It was just two of us and we ordered 3 dishes but there were so many more items on the menu and being served that looked amazing. Highly recommend the chicken wings and South African Bunny Chow!Went back again last week.Tried their ribs which were fantastic along with the usual suspects but finished the meal with their coconut cake which was marvelous. Love this place !', \"Great spot in Seattle! Very intimate restaurant. Cool indoor design. The loaded fries are a must try. It had a spicy sweet chili sauce and red onions on it. So good! The tower of chicken was good as well. It was covered in a sweet and spicy chili/fish sauce. Very delicious ! We ordered as an app for the table! The kale and carrot salad was delicious had a spicy kick to it! The African sunny bunny was intriguing! I didn't personally try it but everyone who ordered said it was delicious. The shakshuka was good to share! Came with warm pita. Yum. The best had to be the Filipino dish. The rice was delicious along with the pork! I would skip the Vietnamese coffee since it was more of a mocha coffee with condensed milk rather than the OG strong Vietnamese coffee I'm used to. The mimosa was perfect! Perfect balance and combo of OJ and champagne! Will def come back!\", 'I was in Seattle and unfortunately tried this place. It took over 10 minutes for anyone to acknowledge us and take our order. While sitting there waiting I looked around at the other tables food and it did not look that good so I was hesitant to order the amount of food I initially intended to try out. The server finally came and was rude and for whatever reason condescending. He asked us if we wanted any of their alcohol and we told him we don\\'t drink alcohol and he said, \"Well that\\'s too bad, we all can\\'t be perfect\". Yeah ooookay buddy :rolling eyes: \\xa0After 25 minutes of waiting, we see 2 plates of food sitting on the counter and after 10 minutes we were wondering if that was ours. We tried to get the attention of anyone that works there but we were ignored or was told someone will be right with you. This restaurant is not that big with what looked like less than 10 table inside. We finally get our food after flagging down someone who wasn\\'t our server. The food was cold and lacked flavor. Their Chengdu Wings are horrible. The restaurant has this Chinese themed decorations and fake Asian fusion menu but no one from the kitchen to the front were Asian so I assume this is owned by someone non-Asian to try and pass this off as Asian food. \\xa0It\\'s ironic we had a server that gave racist vibes towards Asians. Joke is on him, I\\'m half French as well. After our disappointing meal and worse, service. We ate at another restaurant who treated us with respect and served edible hot food with bigger portions and less the price.', \"Unfortunately, Nue fell short of my expectations. Everything seemed like there was a sweetness to them and it was a little too sweet for my liking. I wasn't sure how authentic each cuisine was either. The meal was just OK and I don't see myself coming back. The pineapple cornbread might have been my favorite dish but everything else was mediocre and didn't live up to the hype I read about\", \"It was my first time going with some friends for brunch and I had no idea what to expect - I think I was expecting traditional brunch like pancakes, eggs, etc but that wasn't the case! It's a fusion of dishes from all over the world on one menu and I found that so incredible! I ended up ordering the tosilog which was Filipino inspired since I can't handle spicy food but if I could I would really want to try the chicken and waffles! They are apparently spicy which would be really interesting to try! Chengdu inspired! The tosilog was so good the cured pork was melt in mouth delicious with amazing flavor and good for someone who was king of hungry with a decent rice portion and eggs as well! Note you can customize your eggs so do that before you order! I also tried the limau asam boi non alcoholic beverage which is a lemonade with an Asian plum kick which was really good! Highly recommend coming here and they have lovely outdoor seating in these covid times with a heater to keep warm! Excited to return very soon! And bonus parking wasn't bad either on a Sunday at 12pm!\", 'At first I was doubtful of this place because I find that sometimes places will claim to be \"fusion \"and just mix random flavors together without appreciating the culture where the food came from. I was really surprised by this place and have become a regular for dinner and brunch. They have interesting dishes from all around the world and subtle combinations when it comes to \"fusion \"food, like there\\'s a Chinese chicken and waffles. I\\'ve looked in the south and I\\'ve had amazing chicken waffles, but nothing quite like the lemon peppercorns in the flavor profile of this one. They also have really great drinks. Decor in the restaurant is eclectic and fun, and honestly a great conversation topic. They also have outdoor seating, both at a bar-setting and in a big tent. Usually not too long of a wait for walk-up. Dinner faves include the french street tacos and the cod wrap.', \"Very diverse menu, some hit or miss. While everything is super flavorful, some of the textures didn't gel with me, like the tea leaf salad, African bunny chow, and the French tacos. I absolutely loved the wings and the short ribs, both of which were super tender. The wings have a nice crunch, just enough pepper and a little heavy on fish sauce, but not overpowering. Drink menu is solid as well. Service was helpful and prompt. As for portion size, I definitely recommend sharing multiple dishes to fully enjoy the experience. The decor is very diverse as well, and fits the worldly theme of the restaurant. It's a spot worth checking out, especially if you're into weird things.\", 'The decor in this place was really cool and made you feel like you were on the streets of Asia eating some yummy food. I loved the casual ambiance and sharing the food family style. The chengdu chicken was crispy, sweet, mildly spicy with that Mala flavor. The Brussels sprouts had a tahini sauce at the bottom and was the perfect appetizer or side to have. The bunny chow was so good! I never had curry with toast but I enjoyed it although I think I still prefer eating curry with rice. I like the food concepts here and the food also came out at a great pace', 'I love this place still after different visits. We arrived on Sunday lunch and they were able to find an outdoor table for us. Customer service was nice, they were busy tho so it was a bit of wait. Pineapple cornbread was delicious. It smelled good, it was soft and good amount of sweetness. I love a little bit of coconut on top too. The cambodia salor vegan curry was the best of all the things I have tried on the menu so far. It was creamy, sweet, tasty. I will just come back everytime for the curry then.', 'I love the atmosphere of this place. The service was nice. I made a reservation just in case but got there at 7pm with many tables open. The food were unique. They were good but most of them had lots of bread and curry so I found it was easy to feel bloated. I read the story of the owners couple, and I love their journey to different coutries looking for the best piece and bring back to Seattle. I recommend this place.', \"1 star for a specific staff (Gil) that could have communicated to customers and handled the situation better.Reply: I fully understand what you guys are expected to do and are not taking away that responsibility from you as a business. I just want you guys to understand our frustration as to how it was handled and how I paid for drinks that were taken away full without any communication or apology. Please also note that we did show Gil identification for our friend but was not accepted since her physical copy wasn't there, so he also knew she was of age. I did also call after just to let him know I wasn't happy how that happened (as I was shocked and unable to process what happened right away there) he assured me that he did not feel bad at all for how I was unhappy with how I was treated.\", 'This place is advertised as a small plates/tapas bar. It is anything but. Tried a vegan salad and wings. The salad tasted like a bunch of ingredients slapped together without rhyme or dressing. The wings were just ok. Pretty disappointing meal.', \"Spicy!!!!! \\xa0Small little cafe with asian fusion food. \\xa0Loved the chicken wings! \\xa0The service is a bit slow, but that's because everything is made fresh and they are super busy for a small p\", \"My friend chose this spot for lunch and I came without prior research so I had no idea what to expect...but I was pleasantly pleased by the food and experience here! The restaurant has a very cozy and homey vibe to it. And you'll notice that their menu options are very fusion-y. \\xa0They incorporate a lot of flavors and food from their travel experiences into their dishes. We came on a weekday during lunch hour and it was not hard to find a seat for 4. \\xa0Staff was helpful and we ordered some of their most popular items:-Tower of Chengdu Wings: crispy and flavorful and good heat to it from the birds eye chili peppers!-South African Sunny Bunny: this is definitely an impressive dish. Its like one of those toast boxes thats filled with a yummy curry and a runny egg. Very fun to eat! -Dutch Patat Oorlog (War Chips): which is actually FRIES with yummy mayo, peanut satay, and red onions on top. Great finger food and I loved every bite-Side Pineapple Cornbread: this was my favorite dish haha - maybe its because I love cornbread and I love baking. I was very blown away by the flavors of adding pineapple to it and the tenderness of the dish as well! Definitely a must try if you're coming here :)\", \"we were a party of 3 on a sunday night (around 6:30?), and we were seated immediately! we shared a restaurant week set and ordered an additional dish.the hummus here was possibly the best hummus I've ever had (or maybe I was really hungry) -- the creamy texture contrasted well with the crunchy garlic they topped it with. incredibly flavorful, and tasted so delicious with the hot, fluffy pita bread.the bunny chow was good, but I think I would've enjoyed it much more if it were hot, as some of it was cold by the time it arrived at our table. it was mostly just a standard curry in a fun bread bowl, but I did like the slight lemon(?) flavoring of the curry, which I thought was unique.our table agreed that the chengdu chicken was the most surprising dish -- it came out piping hot, and the mala spice really complemented the wings. I hadn't had fried chicken with this kind of sauce before, I liked it!The chocolate malva ended up being a bit too sweet for our taste, but if you like citrusy chocolate cakes, it might be for you!\", \"I've had Nue on my bookmark list for quite some time. Finally got a chance to visit! It did not disappoint. I had the Chengdu Spicy Jumbo Chicken Wings & South African Bunny Chow. Both dishes were super flavorful. My tastebuds were so happy. The chicken was crispy, juicy, and had a slight kick from the spices. The bread on the bunny chow was slightly tough in the outer edges but the inside was soft as it was soaking up the masala curry. I would've preferred the curry to have a slight kick as I thought it was too sweet. But overall, both dishes were delicious. Service was also quick and they were attentive.\", 'Decided to try out Nue during the pandemic and what a gem of a place in Cap Hill. We chose to sit outdoors. Each table has a heaters and it is nice and cozy. Tables are apart so you dont really feel crammed up in a small place.Now the food - you MUST try their bunny chow (slices of breat inmersed in this flavorful chicken curry), chengdu fried chicken wings (skip the chillies if you want to avoid the heat) and they cod fish satay is also nice. For the dessert we ordered the chocolate Malva and boy it was the perfect ending to our perfect meal. They have a lovely spread of cocktails as well - we enjoyed their mulled wine, jagertee, casters greyhound and a few we chugged that I dont even recollect what we ordered. They staff if nice and polite and taking care of covid precautions (double masked etc).I for sure will be back here frequently and for more!', \"Solid restaurant to visit! I ordered the South African Bunny Chow. It's basically curry on a big loaf of bread. I was a bit skeptical about curry and bread but it actually was pretty good. It was still pretty good, flavorful with a little kick to it. I also tried some of the Frites ordered by my friend; also tasty and love the pairing with both the peanut satay sauce and the Mayo. We made reservations earlier for our party of 7 and there's outside seating which is nice. Our server was cool and helpful. Not bad but a bit overpriced IMO, I didn't feel like the food was incredible or anything special.\", 'Heard a lot about this restaurant so was excited to try it - it was good not great. Brussels sprouts are very good as was the curry dish. Bunny chow was ok. Chicken wings were ok. For the cost I would pick a different restaurant to dine at.', \"The place is small and the food is prepared at the moment, so, be prepared to wait and taste one of your best meals ever! We tried the Nue chicken and Ganahian peas, both delicious! We saw dishes around our table and looked good! We can't wait to go again!\", 'A very unique and fun eatery in Capitol Hill. The restaurant as an eclectic assortment of decorations and is close to other cool places to visit like a book store or ice cream stores. I brought my cousin here when she visited for a week and we split Bunny Chow and Balinese Barbecued Spare Ribs. The spare ribs were exquisite. 10/10. I would recommend the bunny chow if you like curry and bread.', \"Cannot get over this dinner we have had last night! Nue is the best place to catch up friends, date night or a alone date as well! Their food is so soulful and delicious that you'd want to come back again for sure. They picked best foods over the world and have made it their menu. We ordered the house and Yelp favorites- South African bunny chow chow, Chicken paprika wings and Malaysian parota. The grape flavored beer is my Fav, doesn't taste a bit like beer, more like a smooth juice or wine.\", \"Exceptional. Unique. Flavorful. The name of their restaraunt perfectly embodies the essence of their menu (see their about on website). Service was timely, food was fresh, dishes are unique and delicious - I have no complaints on my first brunch expierence here and would reccomend this to anyone looking to deviate from the typical American brunch menu.Came around 12pm on a Sunday and was able to be seated immediately.My table ordered the Filipino topsilog, the South African Sunny Bunny, and Chengdu Chicken & Waffles. Good meal proportion for the hungry. They were all fabulous dishes, but the Chengdu chicken was my absolute favorite - savory & sweet with the perfect crunch in the fried chicken. The Sunny Bunny was a bit on the breadier side, so if you're no looking for a lot of bread, I would steer away from this. The topsilog is authentic and is a perfect example of the dish.The only hesitancy I have as a Filipino, is paying $20+ for their Filipino Topsilog. It was the most expensive tosilog dish I've ever paid for and can make an equally delicious topsilog at home.Overall, this is the perfect restaraunt to go to if you're looking to try something different, a unique menu and savory quality food. Come here for a date, with friends or to catch up with family.\", \"Maybe it's just a difference in palate but the food here was pretty mediocre and pricey. I know their menu changes often so I might try it again in the future.I came here with a group of friends and we got the chendu wings and I got the french tacos. I thought the wings were OK but nothing to really rave about since you could get similar quality wings at Chinese places for cheaper. The french tacos I also thought were mediocre but maybe it's because I was comparing it to other restaurants that specialized in tacos.Overall, I think they do alot and it's very cool how they make so many cuisines but I don't think any of it really stood out.\", \"Great vibe with the theme focused on global travel. very flavorful and tasty food and amazing non-standard drinks. Highly recommend! We were there for brunch time menu and The filipino Tosilog was cooked to perfection and the Cambodian curry was extremely flavorful. We chomped down both the entrees/tapas as they call. They are pretty decent sized portions and were more than filling for one person. Oh and yummy cornbread!! The warm drinks were super tasty and seemed to have made with care. I was impressed with the songs in background too - ranging all over the world and I was ready to bust out in dance moves on a Bollywood dance number too :) The menu for brunch was small but it caters to most of the population and has salads, eggs, chicken, meat, vegan. Perhaps a couple more chicken , but non wings options might have been nice - but I am sure in these COVID times it's hard to have a large menu .The travel vibe was fascinating as we were inside and it was so very decorated with things from all over the world. They do have tents with outdoor seating and temp propane tank based heaters - not sure how effective they were. Because the door was open, I was feeling slightly cold even inside and had my coat on the full time. But I saw others in t-shirts and comfortable. I can't wait to try this place again for brunch or dinner or even simply for drinks.Oh and forgot to mention that the cost of dishes were standard seattle rates - not cheap, nor expensive. The service was overall great. Also a pro-tip: call in to get waitlisted if going at peak time of lunch/dinner. They have happy hour 3-6pm.\", 'What a worldly menu- and they had dishes from everywhere. We tried a couple of \\xa0their dishes and this is what we thought: Trinidadian roti and channa which was 8/10 -nicely spiced and favored and the roti was top. Pineapple and coconut cornbread-7/10- melts in your mouth and good appetizer. The coconut all over seemed a little messy. Chendung spicy wings-9/10- must try! Seasoned really well and the red chillies sure give you a kick! South African Molvo - cake with chocolate sauce and peanuts- 7/10- reminds me of a steamed ube/tapioca cake. Was good but a little too heavy as a dessert.', 'If anyone is looking for the cuisines from the world, this is the place to go. With eclectic decor, amazing staff and best chefs, this place is a must visit. I recommend South African Bunny Chow and chicken wings for sure.', \"Tried this neighborhood place that sounded interesting. Our server was very nice, but the food left a lot to be desired. It was VERY expensive. I ordered the Burmese Laphet Toke, Fermented Tea Leaf Salad, for $19. It looked stale. It was spicy, but I expected it to be more like the fresher separated ingredients type tea leaf salad I get in San Francisco. After eating the whole thing, I was still hungry. Being gluten free, there weren't a lot of choices. There was a bbq pork dish on rice that was priced at a whopping $36! I asked if I could get a half portions, since I just dropped $20 on a salad. The server came back from the kitchen with bad news. No. We left and went to Momiji for some sashimi which was fantastic. Sadly, we won't be back.\", 'My friend and I were in Seattle for vacation and my friend was looking places to eat and Nue caught her attention so we decided to check it out. Food was amazing. Definitely would recommend.', \"I am glad they are still in business after lockdown. The restaurant if one of a kind. They have all unique food from around the world, especially south East Asian food. I have been going there for nearly 3 years and notice a few changes in the menu, which is great. Because I get to try new food! They are doing both indoor and outdoor seating. I call ahead to reserve for indoor and seated right away. The service, food, drinks are great but the reason why I didn't give the remaining star is because the Sate Liet said it's spicy in the menu but it wasn't even remotely spicy. And there are a lot of ginger and lemongrass in it that I didn't really enjoy. Ribs were great tho. A huge portion too!\", \"I came here for brunch and it was such a great experience. Get the war fries. They're soooo good, and really perfect for sharing. I ate the Filipino tosilog and the pork was yummy but only order this plate if you're really hungry - it's a lot of food. I would 100% come back here.\", 'Nue is a fairly unique restaurant offering cuisines from multiple cultures. \\xa0From what I can tell, it\\'s not accurate to call them fusion as it doesn\\'t seem like they are attempting to reinvent/redo dishes. \\xa0Instead, they offer genuine dishes at good quality; I much prefer this restaurant model.It\\'s hard to decide what to choose on their menu as everything looks delicious. \\xa0They basically offer some of the best options across different nationalities. \\xa0I opted for a dish that is a popular favorite of the restaurant (Bunny Chow) and a personal favorite (tea leaf salad). \\xa0The food:South African Bunny Chow - $20 - 5 StarsA Rich Chicken, Tomato & Garam Masala Curry Served in a Pullman Bread Bowl.

Fermented Tea Leaves, Fried Garlic, Butterfly Peas, Chickpeas, Sesame, Lemon, Peanuts, Napa Cabbage & Spice (Vegan, Gluten Free)I have had many of these salads from the Bay Area in CA. \\xa0This version has plenty of fermented tea leaves, which I like. \\xa0Somehow, the mixture is drier than I remember and the veggies are bigger cuts than I know. \\xa0It\\'s not as \"salad\" as I know it to be. \\xa0In any case, the flavor is still good, but I still prefer mine from the Bay Area. \\xa0I\\'ll be back to try more dishes for sure.', \"I love, love the tea salad! \\xa0We came by with a group of friends and literally ordered all the dishes. \\xa0A few of us are vegan so it was nice have an array of vegan main dishes like the pumpkin curry with roti, hummus and hands the best and unique dish is the Burmese tea salad! \\xa0We had the chicken wings, the bunny chow, and BBQ ribs for meat. \\xa0All was delicious! \\xa0Now I'm going to be coming here more often.\", \"I've been here a couple times and each time has been a great experience.I highly recommend their South African Bunny Chow - it's full of flavor and is a great portion.Service here is really good as well~I'd recommend not driving if you have the option. Street parking is often very difficult to find. Alternatively, you can pay for parking in a paid lot though~\", 'Good establishment in Seattle. Good food Bites and variety options available in affordable price ranges. From lite, fried, to vegans options. To add, great cocktails and beer options. Not many establishments will compare, so check it out for yourself.', \"Super creative brunch place. Feels like traveling around the world when you come here with the eclectic mix of cuisines (Indian, Asian, South African, American) yet they execute it so well.The South African Sunny Bunny is to die for. Massive stuffed french toast with creamy curry chicken. Other things are outrageous too but this is the thing to get. If you get the Chengdu chicken, go with the tower and not the waffle (it's all about their chicken, no one cares about the waffles, just get Brussel sprouts if you want something to go with the chicken).\", \"Amazing! I'm almost at a loss for words at how incredible this place is. I've been drooling over the menu for a couple months now, but just getting to try it and the foods exceeded every expectation! Couple that with impeccable service, special thank you to Junior, and incredible drinks; this is my new favorite go to spot.\", 'I heard good things about this spot, especially since they have South African bunny chow. Stopped by with some friends for dinner, the seating was was outside, a little chilly but they supplied propane heaters which did an amazing job at keeping us warm. I got the bunny chow, which ironically I never had in South Africa even as a local, it was really good :) The chicken wings were gigantic, monster chicken offspring for sure. The Szechuan on the wings was a surprise element. If you do t like the tingly sensation then skip it but I enjoyed the flavor and crispiness. The goat curry was also pretty flavorful but the star of that dish was the corn bread. All in all a great spot for eclectic food :)', 'Such a great little spot. The food was amazing and well worth the trip. We tried the house made pita with dipping sauce, the ribs, eggplant curry, and Merguez burrito. Not to mention the coconut dream cake.The pots was soft and perfection as an appetizer. The Merguez burrito was so rich I needed to slow down and savor it. The French fries inside could have been crispier texturally but the flavors were out of this world. The ribs however stole the show. Super tender ribs with a sweet soy glaze and a subtle lemongrass flavor. So incredibly delicious!And the Lebowski rug that tied it all together? The coconut dream cake. Be warned, it will ruin other cakes for you.', \"Interesting and good enough to come back. \\xa0What we tried initially wasn't amazing but also wasn't bad.\", \"Came here with a group and had a great time! Very eclectic menu with food from all over the world. My favorite dish was the chicken wings which are just packed with flavor. So good! \\xa0The bunny chow was a super interesting dish which is unlike anything I've had before. Very tasty. The restaurant is filled with interesting things from across the world to reflect the menu\", \"The chicken wings looked picturesque and drew me into trying this restaurant. This was my first experience with food cooked in fish oil and the other herbs and spices used to season the chicken so I was pretty disappointed with the flavor. I love how unique the restaurant is with the decor and menu items, but I don't think it's a menu for my taste palette.\", \"Wow, love the menu. I was so excited to take my boyfriend here when I found it on yelp. Luckily it was close to our Airbnb. I got the South African Bunny and my boyfriend got the Chicken and Waffles. Both were delicious and sooooo much food. Warning- South African bunny is like a brick toast with curry so the inside will eventually get all mushy. And if you're not used to Asian spice, the chicken wings might hit you different. Overall delicious food and very chill vibe. Definitely recommending this place to all my friends going to visit.\", 'I literally told my server Lucy that I was having a reaction to their chicken & the first thing she does is grab our check to go add the glass of milk I requested instead of asking if I was ok. THEN she started folding napkins & silverware & only had the common courtesy to get it when I stared at her. (This was after she was staring at my phone over my shoulder after we first sat down while I looked for my partners vaccine card). Would not come back & would not recommend coming here.', 'Oh boy, what a find. The eclectic interior, the fun and worldly decor, capturing culture and mysteries from around the world and allowing us to venture into a world of international choices is great. So many vegetarian options too! All my colleagues enjoyed it. I tasted the Ghana Red Red with rice, excellent suggestion from the hostess. My colleagues loved their peri peri chicken, the tea leaf salad and the hummus. The Egyptian Brussels sprouts would be for the next time... the Malaysian lime/plum drink was yummy too... could have more desert options. Space is a bit limited but packed with curious to see... overall great experience', 'I love the concept and the variety of food that the restaurant offers. The place is quite small so if you have a big party I would suggest making a reservation first otherwise you might have to wait a long time for a table. We ordered a variety of different items to share and they were all pretty solid \\xa0dishes. I loved the Syrian Kale & Carrot Salad and the South African Bunny Chow. The Chengdu Wings tower was a meh for me. It was aesthetic and great for photos but I thought it was a bit too saucy for me.', \"Amazing brunch spot in Capitol Hill!Made a reservation midweek for Saturday morning, and we were seated super promptly upon arrival. Staff was super friendly and helpful.For 2 people, we ordered the Mo Mosa (it's a lot of mimosa....), pineapple cornbread, chengdu chicken and waffles, and Israeli shakshuka. The dishes were honestly a super generous portion, and between the mimosa and food we were beyond stuffed.It thought the pineapple cornbread and chengdu chicken and waffles were the more unique dishes, the shakshuka was good but mostly what you would expect.Solid brunch option with great decor and service!\", 'Love how unique the menu is. \\xa0The decorations inside are worth the trip, alone. \\xa0Wonderful for happy hour, too!', \"We got takeout from here and I would definitely come back for dine in since the space is so cute. Food was pretty good, though I would not recommend the water beetles. I've had my share of insects these these were just toooo salty. Maybe if it came with rice or something. The ribs were my fav thing we got.\", 'Nice bustling spot on capital hill. Lot of unique dishes to try with a good atmosphere.', 'We came here for dinner and were very happy to see that they offered dine-in via outside seating. They also had a warmer available for the cold weather. We asked the waitress for recommendations and we ordered: Chengdu Spicy Jumbo Chicken Wings -Super tasty and jam packed with Frankie-wings are huge and full of meat -spicy but so worthy Cubano Sandwich & Spicy Fries-Very authentic (I am cuban)-the pickles was my fave part of the sandwich-the meat was tenderSouth African Bunny Chow-So good for cold weather -the bread bowl is delicious-curry was tasty and had a nice kick I highly recommend this place if you have an adventurous palate and like to taste good with a lot of flavor.', \"Tasty restaurant with a lot of interesting options. If you're into spices and a casual atmosphere, this place is for you. Wait was not terrible, service was okay because it's more of a casual spot. Eclectic decor, clean restrooms.\", \"Cool menu! We had the Bunny Chow, the South African Malva dessert, and a couple of cocktails. Both dishes were tasty and unique, but the cocktails were just okay, as they were a little weak. Perhaps because it was happy hour and they were $2.00 off? The whole time we were there we watched other dishes going by, and we wanted all of them. Food was served quickly, service was friendly, and the outdoor seating was comfortable. We can't wait to go back for ribs and pineapple cornbread.\", \"I'll lead with the highlights - the chicken wings were phenomenal, definitely one of the best dishes I've had in Seattle. Another highlight is that they use the Yelp Waitlist feature so you can get a spot in line while having a drink elsewhere. The wait for our table of 3 was about an hour on a weeknight. The downside was the service which was so bad we considered leaving. I hesitate to write this because I know that post-COVID restaurants are struggling to find staff and new folks may still be training. But we sat for 30 minutes without anyone coming to even give us a water. There were only 5 tables inside and the table next to us was clearly having the same experience. It felt pretty clear they were prioritizing takeout orders and that's where the staff put their attention. I finally got up and just asked a waiter if we could order. If I hadn't I'm pretty sure we would never have been waited on. I also had to direct the waiter over to the other table. So, if you go, know you be assertive about flagging someone down to order.\", 'Come for the vibe, stay for the fantastic street food! Everything we had was amazing! The wings are outstanding.', \"Wow those Chengdu Chicken Wings. Great flavor, SPICY, \\xa0moist, and that CRUNCH. The Chickpea Curry was alright but dang super al dente chickpeas. I expected and would've liked more stewed, softer ones. The sides that came with it I didn't care for; one tasted like it had horseradish in it.I'd go back and try other dishes.\", 'The food here was amazing! The pineapple coconut cornbread and the trinidadian curry were delicious! The Beirut hummus was also very good! We sat on the patio which was nice. There was a bit of a wait for two for a Friday night dinner. Service was good as well.', \"A cute little restaurant featuring many different types of cuisines -- I'm generally deeply skeptical of restaurants which don't focus on one regional cuisine because it's hard to get everything right but Nue proved me wrong! They have a small outdoor seating setup for COVID and a limited menu as well but it was a great experience all around. I got the Malaysian Kari Kentang, a curry dish with roti on the side, and loved it! The roti was flaky and the curry was delicious and flavorful as well. My friends got the South African Bunny Chow and loved it too! I definitely hope to be back or order from here to treat myself.\", 'Overpriced and underwhelming. I like the eclectic menu but the cornbread was dry and salty, fries were basic, the shark bake had decent flavor but soggy. The wings were the best but not enough for me to go back.', 'Super Delish! If you are visiting in Seattle - good place to eat! I like their Happy Hour choices! Good stuff!', 'Nice place to go with friends! Restaurant usually super busy better make a reservation before u go.', \"This place is a passport to Flavor Town! \\xa0We stumbled onto this small restaurant by happenstance so we had zero expectations/bias. We found the variety of food to be more than satisfying, and the atmosphere had energy. \\xa0My French Tacos were great, and my guy loved the Bunny Chow, just the right amount of spice! We split the chocolate Malvasia cake. \\xa0I'd say the service was a little off, she forgot our frites and it took forever to get our check, but it didn't spoil our experience. We will definitely be back.\", 'Amazing food, service and outdoor seating. Will definitely return with another large party - thanks :-) I LOVE the concept of this restaurant. All 8 of us loved our meals.', 'My favorite thing was the \\xa0chicken and waffle . The place is smaller than I expected though.', \"Amazing food! I don't normally like friend chicken but this has been the best I've tried. It does have a kick to it but it's not overwhelmingly greasy like many other fried chickens. The tolisog was delicious as well, the meat was chewy which I had no issues with. The rice was a bit bland but tasted better when mixed with the egg. Pay to park nearby. Outdoor seating available.\", 'I totally recommend this brunch place! They have a good variety of food from different countries with a nice twist!Try the chicken and waffles or the shakshuka!', \"I loooove their corn bread. I am not a huge fan of chicken and waffle but they made me a believer! I can't wait to come back for brunch! Their menu is super creative and encompasses different culture; I love the concept. Service is ok, could use some improvements on customer service.\", \"This restaurant is so unique and their menu is also one-of-a-kind. Service was good and the food came out so quickly probably because they can only take a small number of tables at a time since their space is small even with the patio outside. Even though we could only get reservations after 9pm, it was so worth it! I got the bunny chow and my boyfriend got the ribs and we both loved our choices. The pineapple cornbread wasn't my favorite but that's probably because I don't love cornbread I general. Highly recommend this place if you want to try something new and interesting!\", \"First meal after flying into Seattle! My friend recommended Nue and said they always come for the Chengdu Spicy Jumbo Chicken Wings so that's exactly what we ordered. The wings definitely packed a punch, my first bite was pretty spicy but after that it wasn't too bad, very enjoyable! We also got the Pacific cod and shrimp skewers (I don't have the exact name of the dish from the menu) - it came with three skewers and rice on the side. These skewers were also flavorful, wish I had more. The brussel sprouts we ordered were tasty, I liked both of the unique sauces it came with, especially the yellow one. Lastly, we got the roti, so flaky and delicious. I liked dipping it into the yellow sauce from the brussel sprouts. The dishes were all smaller than I thought, or maybe because I was sharing everything family style with two other guys. At the end of the meal, we were still a little hungry for more. Next time, I'd order more food, it's great to share everything and try different dishes. On a Friday night, we got a table at 9:30 out on their temporary covered patio and got seated quickly. There were still many diners inside and outside even at that time. The staff are friendly. Parking was a little tricky, you have to find street parking and it was all taken already so we had to make some loops before finding a spot. Overall, had a good experience and I definitely enjoyed the unique food here, would come back!\", \"Rotating menu, tasty dishes and attentive service. It's a bit small and ambience is lacking but food and service makes up for it. \\xa0Try their Shakshuka and corn bread!\", \"I just got take out from here and was disappointed in the amount of food I received for the price. I paid around $100 for some ribs, fried chicken wings, the bunny chow which was a curry with 1/3 loaf of white bread, and a dessert cake. Everything here tasted okay but it's over priced!! The ribs would have been $25 somewhere else given portion size but they wanted over $30 here. $15 somewhere else for the wings but they wanted $19. Bunny chow was a chicken curry that should have been $18 max but it costs $20. The dessert was $12 but should have been $9.Everything tastes over spiced but nothing spectacular compared to Indian, Thai, or Vietnamese equivalents at other restaurants in ID or Wallingford. I won't be back. I'm appalled at the prices for the quality and taste of the dishes.\", \"I've never had such a bad experience at a restaurant before I tried Nue. My partner and I were seated near the window next to a guy waiting for someone else. The guy got angry that we were seated near him for some reason and asked the waiter to move us. Somehow the waiter complied with this and requested we move to a shared table. Honestly thinking back on this this was really not appropriate but we went along with it anyway since it didn't really bother us at the time. Then we decided to sit next to each other on the same side of the table since the whole table/restaurant was almost empty but the waiter got angry at us and told us to sit across from each other. There was no need to be so aggressive when the restaurant was not busy and it was a simple mistake we weren't aware of. \\xa0It made us feel really horrible for the rest of the night.Apart from the service, the food itself was 3 star level -- okay but not very thoughtful or balanced. We got the chengdu wings and the ribs. The former was overly spiced and had no other flavor than 'hot'. The ribs were sickly sweet but better than the wings because they at least had flavor. It just seems like their offerings are a non-asian tourist's take on 'weird' food that is more focused on giving a 'hipster worldly' vibe and not focused on respecting the origins or nuance of the food. There are plenty of other Asian-fusion/influenced restaurants in the neighborhood like Stateside that are much more deserving of your time and money.\", 'Nue is an adorable, eclectic, and offbeat little spot in Capitol Hill that is always bustling. When I first heard it was global cultural cuisine, I was a bit apprehensive, but their food is absolutely fantastic. We had the Trinidadian Curried Channa and Aloo and the Chengdu Spicy Jumbo Chicken Wings, and the preparation, taste and presentation were all on point. I was impressed with the curried channa which was not too rich and quite flavorful. The Chengdu Spicy wings definitely lived up to their name. I would highly recommend making a reservation, since the place was continuously busy all night long, and for good reason!', \"The first time I came to Nue, I got very sick immediately after eating here and had to run to the bathroom while still at the restaurant! I decided to give this place another shot given it was a friend's birthday brunch and I didn't want to make a fuss. This time, however, I found hairs in my food TWICE, even after they made a new order for me. The meat was also burnt. I highly do not recommend coming here. \\xa01) Service (-): While Nue was able to accommodate a large group of us with short notice, I found hair in my food and asked to send it back. The servers were not very apologetic, even when I found hair in my food a SECOND time. 2) Ambiance (-): The restaurant was very loud and over the course of our 2 hour stay here, we heard lots of dropped pans and pots from the open kitchen. 3) Food (- -): I ordered the Filipino Tapsilog-cured pork and garlic fried rice. The meat was very burnt, there was hair in my food, enough said. 4) Alcohol (+): There was a good selection of drinks and I had a gin cocktail that was pretty good. 5) Value for Money (-): Certainly on the more expensive end of the restaurant spectrum for Capitol Hill, especially considering the clear lack of food preparation hygiene and professionalism.\", \"The first time I came to Nue, I got very sick immediately after eating here and had to run to the bathroom while still at the restaurant!

I've gone here many times over the years, both for dinner and brunch, and have always left full and happy. Ordering the shakshuka for brunch is almost a meme, you have to order it. For dinner, my go-to recommendations are the South African bunny chow and the Chengdu chicken wings, which pair nicely with a Nue Fashioned! The service is sometimes hit or miss, especially since it gets extremely busy, but the food always makes up for it. Highly recommended.\", 'Gluten free option available! There was a 30 minute wait to be seated. Our server Lucy was polite although seemingly too busy. We ordered the Trinidadian Curried Channa and Aloo with a Roti Flatbread The curry is tasty and pretty spicy. The Roti Flatbread has a sweetness that is such a delicious pairing Very small portion size! We ordered the Limau Asam Boi drink We did not like at all. Tastes similar to Tropicana but twice as tart. They did not allow us to exchange or refund the drink. Our server said that is the rule of the owner.', 'Uh May Zing \\xa0Simply amazing. \\xa0Fifty four more characters of amazing food review. Come on yelp, let me use as few words as I would like. The food and the place is amazing.', \"I got the fried chicken wings and waffles. Overall, it was good. You can tell it was marinated for hours. My only thing is that the flavor didn't leave room to enjoy the chicken meat. The marinade and fish cause created a bite and sustained aftertaste. If I get this again, I'll ask for the sauce on the side. I found myself eating he waffle for something dry in order to balance the overpowering flavors.\", \"[Quarantine Delivery]Me and my friend had been eyeing on NUE's delivery options for quite a while, and we're so glad we did end up trying these! We ordered the Pineapple Cornbread, Malaysian Kari Kentang, and Chengdu Spicy Jumbo Chicken Wings.* Pineapple Cornbread : Buttery, soft, and it crumbles in your mouth right away. Love the coconut flakes on top that added some crunchy texture to it. Wish there was more pineapple flavor though.* Malaysian Kari Kentang : Spicier than I thought but still durable. Amazing rich coconut curry with fresh red pepper and spiraled cucumbers on the side. The roti was kind of hard but the buttery flavor goes well with the curry.* Chengdu Spicy Jumbo Chicken Wings : Crispy outer skin that coated the juicy and tender meat on the inside. My friend thinks the spices were balanced out pretty well with the sweet fish sauce, and the spiciness from the green Szechuan peppercorn was just the right amount!Overall, great takeout food and we cannot wait to come here and try out the other items on the menu when everything's back to normal!\", 'Wow what a lovely ambience and food was delicious .What more you want for a Friday evening dinner .We were 8 and restaurant people were kid enough to accommodate us and waited for us few mins over the booking time. Their peshwari kebab , corn bread , Brussels sprouts were amazing .I am a new blogger trying to collect my own database of restaurants and this one is going in my list', \"Nue was EXCELLENT. Was visiting from out of town and a friend suggested we go here -- I'm so glad we did! We had their famous chicken wing tower, the slow cooked ribs, the fermented tea leaf salad, and the Brussels sprouts. It was all so so yummy and our server was very friendly and helpful with the recommendations. Will say that the food tends to be spicy, so if you have a low spice tolerance, be sure to ask your waiter!\", 'Came here during a visit to Seattle for dinner and was able to snag online reservations on their website through Yelp! I checked out the photos on Yelp prior to visiting and saw a lot of dishes catch my eye, but upon arrival and looking at the menu, I realized some of the options I wanted to try were only during brunch/lunch. Might be something to consider if you\\'re looking to visit. Regardless, we still had a delicious meal (mostly) and ordered the Portuguese Peri Peri Chicken Sandwich, Istanbul Islak \"Wet Burger\", Chengdu Spicy Jumbo Chicken Wings, War Fries, Balinese Barbecued Spare Ribs, and South African Bunny Chow.I would say everything was definitely worth getting, but I was disappointed by the Wet Burger. While the flavor was decent, I expected slightly more than a meat patty with just a sauce and bun. It was for sure my fault, as they describe it pretty clearly in the menu, but don\\'t think I would get it again. It was also served to me in a foil wrapping, which seemed odd for a dine-in situation.Otherwise, the chicken wings and spare ribs stole the show! I really enjoyed the variety of cuisine options from all over the world, and would definitely come back to try their brunch menu + more of their drink options!', 'Designed for adventurous eaters, Nue takes you on a culinary adventure around the world! Not only did the menu feature unusual dishes with influences from many different cuisines, the dining room was decorated from floor to ceiling with kitsch from all around the globe, travel guides to every destination you could think of, and even a QR-code menu placard that was meant to resemble a boarding pass for a flight departing from Seattle. We started our meal with the Pineapple Cornbread, a dense, heavy, sweet, and savory bread made with butter & love (according to the menu). The most popular dish was the South African Bunny Chow, a hollowed out loaf of Pullman Bread filled with a chicken curry made with tomatoes and garam masala, topped with cilantro, lime zest, and yogurt. The Ghanaian Red Red was a traditional African stew made with cowpeas, red palm, ginger, garlic, tomatoes, sari (fermented cassava), and tender roasted goat, served with chewy white rice and fried plantains on the side. Finally, we had the Balinese Barbecued Spare Ribs, a generous portion of six grilled pork ribs marinated in garlic, galangal, candlenut, lemongrass, turmeric, and chilies, and basted with a sweet soy glaze. The spare ribs were fall-off-the-bone tender but still had a nice bite, and the flavor was dominated by the sweet and savory soy glaze, which also went nicely with the white rice that came on the side. This casual, decked-out restaurant always seems to be changing its menu offerings, and just as well, because there are simply too many dishes and cuisines that are worth featuring and experimenting with!', \"Nueis a great spot if you are looking for unique, flavorful cuisine. They have all sorts of dishes from South Africa to Israel to Pakistan and beyond. We went there for brunch and got the shakshuka and the Chengdu tower of wings. I've been to Tel Aviv and shakshuka is a standard breakfast dish there. Nue's shakshuka (for me) didn't have quite the same seasoning as it does in Israel but was good nonetheless. The Chengdu wings had a really sweet sauce on it, which isn't my thing when eating wings, but my sister really liked them. We also got a carafe of the mo' mosa. Little too heavy on the orange juice for my liking ;)Overall it is a really great brunch spot if you're looking for something out of the ordinary!\", \"Nice fusion place for a brunch. The staff is nice but service is a bit slow. They have an eclectic menu with few dishes inspired from different parts of the world. The South African bunny chow is excellent and is a must try! One of the best dishes I have had. Very flavorful curry and the egg is cooked perfectly. We did not like the chengdu chicken and waffles as the chicken tasted bland and dry. It's a small place so the there aren't many seating areas so there tends to be a wait on the weekends.\", \"This place was pretty good. Really enjoyed the travel vibe and what not.

GREAT FIND! \\xa0 Bon Appetite\", 'Exciting and out-of-the-box global menu with items featuring flavors and ingredients from distinct and random parts of the world.Cambodia, South Africa, Syria and China are wonderfully represented. They have brunch menus seven days a week. We went on a Sunday (call ahead as the seating is very limited).Let\\'s start with the best Bloody Mary I\\'ve had in many years. The triple distilled vodka has a variety of additions including Golden Mountain seasoning, lime a dash of sambal at is tart and only slightly spicy. An excellent morning adult beverage.Nue is famous for its \"Chengdu\" fried chicken wings. Ordered by itself, there are three wings and two legs in a stack. The flavor is out of this world (heat lovers beware the red thai chilis). However, our order was not close to crispy and the skin just kind of dripped off the meat. Bummer.The Cambodian eggplant in simmered coconut curry sauce was decadent and delish. Its richness does make a little go a long way.I admire the boldness of the kitchen to try so many disparate elements. Just wish they had nailed their famous chicken. Maybe just an off morning in the deep fryer.', \"An eclectically decorated asian fusion cafe. I think you'll find something you recognize on the menu and some you won't. We picked a couple new items and some standards including Irish Calcannon Potatoes, Portuguese Peri Peri Chicken Sandwich, Pineapple Cornbread, Trinidadian Goat Curry, Frites. Everything was amazing but i think my favorite was the chicken sandwich. Similar to a Southern spicy chicken sandwich with some flavor nuances you won't find elsewhere. Oh yeah, we also had the roti. Remembering now because we were dipping it in the goat curry - yum. The roti were flaky, buttery and warm. Will be back to try the beetles and balut.\", \"This is a little hidden gem in Capitol Hill with fusion twist to their cuisine. My friends and I got Chengdu Spicy Jumbo Chicken Wings, South African Bunny Chow, and Trinidadian Goat Curry. The fried wings certainly have a kick to it with the Thai chili peppers and peppercorn, each bite burn but so savory that you want to continue. \\xa0The bunny chow is served in a squared bread bowl/box, which is unique. It tasted like Indian curry which is very aromatic and delicious. You can taste the Caribbean spice in the goat curry, and it was not gamy at all. I wasn't a huge fan of the pineapple cornbread by itself, but it was a great combination with the curry. Would love to come back and try other fusion dishes.\", 'Great place to try street food from around the world. Check their site for the current menu as it changes. The place is small so check in. We tried the chengdu chicken, Ghanaian Red Red, and Flemish Frites and they were all terrific. We definitely would come back and try other items.', 'Amazing restaurant! I love the food and ambiance every time I come here. Great for brunch, lunch, and dinner!', \"This was a Nue spot for me and I'm glad I tried it! We waited about 10 minutes with heaters outside to dine in on a Sunday evening. The place was decorated in a unique and cool way, reminds me of markets in south East Asia. Anyways the service was friendly and the menu had a large variety of Asian fusion food. We got the chicken and the fish/shrimp skewer dish. It was both excellent, good portion size and lots of flavor. I probably would order a side of rice with the wings however. I'd come back!\", \"Brought a friend here when she was visiting from San Francisco, and she was impressed. We were so full after eating here that we could hardly walk. The portions are pretty large, and we appreciated the cultural references sprinkled throughout the decor. We sat near the window and got to people watch. Highly recommend if you're looking for flavorful food and chill atmosphere in the Cap Hill district.\", \"I've had Nue bookmarked for awhile and was excited to try it for the first time during restaurant week! It was easy to make a reservation and they had updated menus on the SRW website, which was great. We tried the kale salad, pineapple cornbread, hummus, bunny chow, and baklava. The pineapple cornbread and bunny chow were the best dishes we had that night, but it seemed like there were other great options on their regular menu. While the food was good, I'm giving them 3 stars because the service was just okay. First off, the tables are REALLY close together, so when servers come over to check on the table next to you, their butts are basically on your table. It's a small space, but it seems like of inconvenient for the staff to place their tables like that? Secondly, I felt rushed to make a drink decision and wasn't given time to look at the menu so just went with what the server recommended - when I checked the menu later, the drink itself wasn't as they described and it was also the most expensive one. Lastly, we were told we only had 10 minutes left for our table, which is totally fine and we were happy to get going, but then no one brought our check over for awhile. When it came, we got our card out to pay, but then no one picked it up. The host came over and said she needed the table ASAP as if asking why we didn't leave yet. Overall, not a great way to end the subpar service experience. While food was good, I don't think I'll be back.\", \"I love their eclectic food and drinks, atmosphere, and seating options! Highly recommend the Ghanaian red red (with goat if they have it) and Gujurati Brussels sprouts. I *would* recommend the roti, but up until the last time I visited, the roti included some sort of curry on the side, and this time it didn't. Not only did they not warn me, it was like 20 minutes until I saw our server again to ask about the curry, and I had to flag them down, which I never do, besides the fact that the roti came first and we had another app + all our entrees still on the way... and no, it wasn't half as busy as the usual Nue dinner rush nor a quarter as busy as the usual Nue weekend brunch rush. Key reason for 3 stars is that the service is hit or miss. I've been here a dozen times throughout the last few years (and more recently 6 times in the last two months), and half the time I get friendly, helpful, and prompt servers and hosts, and the other half of the time they are rude and not great at service (and yes, having worked in the service industry, I think rude::sloppy service correlate in terms of serving skills, not simply customer perception, don't @ me). If Nue service was better I'd recommend this place a lot more highly -- as it stands I don't really feel motivated to come back here and drop $100+ per check for two after such polar experiences these past recent visits.\", \"I've been wanting to come here for months because I find their concept very interesting. My main goal was to try Israeli Shaksuka ($18 as of May 2021) and let me tell you- it was fantastic! So many interesting flavors! I also tried the South African Sunny Bunny ($20 as of May 2021) and it was great too, although I don't normally eat anything with Indian Masala for breakfast. I also appreciate the fact that their full menu is on the website with prices.I strongly recommend making a reservation for the weekend brunch. We were sat by the entrance outside and a lot of people had to wait because there were no tables available.\", \"Checked out this place today and was very disappointed in the service. It was around lunch time- the wknd menu is very limited compared to dinner so if you want to try more things, I suggest going after 3pm when dinner the menu is available. My friend ordered the chicken and waffles, I got the filipino tosilog dish. My friend got her food and I didn't get mine until she was about done. I noticed this happened to the people next to us as well, one was brought their food and the other didn't get there's till way later. I'm not sure if this is what they do but I just was really annoyed. Food was pretty good, service needs improvement.\", \"This hidden gem deserves some attention. With already amazing reviews and mouthwatering images to showcase their dishes, I had to take the time to review this spot. Food: South African Bunny Chow - I would eat this all over again if I could. The curry was savory and was the perfect thickness that I love all my curry sauces to be like. The bread was not soggy and absorbed all the flavors this dish had to offer. A perfect item to share or to eat by yourself. Pineapple Corn Bread - This complimented the South African Bunny Chow so well. There is a dish that had Goat Curry over the corn bread but I don't eat goat so I had this had a side dish. There is a nice crusted layer of coconut flakes that completed the bread. I was kind of disappointed that there were no pineapple bits but maybe it was the slice I had that had none. Service: The one staff member we encountered was super friendly. He was very attentive and made me feel very welcomed. He recommended dishes and that was very helpful. Overall, I would come here again. I would love to try their fried chicken and other dishes that stood out to me. I can only eat so much at a time but this gives another reason to come back!\", \"Such a fun place! We sat at the bar and had amazing cocktails by our very entertaining bartender Junior. The food was amazing. We loved the Brussels sprouts. Just \\xa0be warned it's very popular.\", \"I love the idea of this place, really cool concept and great vibes. it's like your uncle's shed full of his travel souvineirs. ate here twice, same menu each time I think.the food was good but the portions aren't relative to the price. Go for the experience, then finish at a chinese restaurant somewhere - that's what I did. hostess was nice, called and was given prompt notice when our table was ready. really wish they had a waiting spot though - it was cold and even a space heater out the door wouldve been helpful.\", 'Such a freaking awesome food place!I love the waffles chicken, it is amazing.Their recipe for the fried chicken is really special,If u taste carefully you will feel a tiny little of flavor of basil.Although the restaurant is small and kind of messy, but their food is crazy gooooood! I ll come back again!', 'Went with a friend and we shared two meals on the menu along with the mimosa. Everything tasted very good and I loved the vibe.', \"Nue is an unassuming storefront, dominated by a large, but simple, sign. As you enter, you see a smallish restuarant - a single room with a few tables clustered close together, a bar-with-the-works in the background and an open kitchen. The decor is colorful and eclectic, and the walls are cluttered with books, travel guides and a lot of mementos artlessly arranged on the bookselves. The restaurant isn't fancy, but it's very comfortable. It's the kind of place where everything you see seems vaguely meaningful, like if only you spoke the same language each bric-a-brac has a rich, insightful and somewhat-funny story to tell you. Like most places nowadays Nue has dispensed with the time-honored tradition of menus in favor of QR codes. Interestingly, the little paper sign with the QR code looks like a boarding pass, and our table is on it's way to Cairo, Eqypt. Which is fitting, when you open the link and find yourself on a gastronomic journey that spans the globe! It's a no small menu, but varied, and the dishes come from all over. We end up sharing an Israeli Shakshuka with a simply-fabulous sauce, a deconstructed, delicious Kabuli Burger and an addictive Tower of Chengdu wings crispy-fried to perfection and dripping in spicy-tangy-sweet sauce tossed in julienned basil with birds-eye chili. Everthing was amazing, and what felt like a lot of food ended up being entirely decimated - quite literally 'finger-licking' good.\", \"This was an interesting experience. I can't quite nail down what type of cuisine this was. Definitely Asian but fell like this was fusion of a lot of Asian countries in the pacific. Mostly everything was nice but the Burmese skewer shrimp was a disappointment, not at all what I imagined what they describe it as shrimp on a skewer. The drinks were decent, didn't recognize any of the flavors or ingredients, nor a bad thing but it was hard to decide and end up not liking most of what I ordered. This was definitely a gastronomic experience, I would only recommend it to people who are foodies and those who are familiar with this type of cuisine. Overall good experience but I wish I knew more about the cuisine and had set my expectations appropriately\", 'What a unique and fun spot! My friends and I had a blast trying it out, and I definitely had a kick out of the cobra & scorpion drink.', \"Good food but they add 20% gratuities to bill. Didn't like that, other then that great food.\", 'The menu is interesting with a wide variety. For that, I think it deserves an above average rating. However, none of the food was super impressive. Good but not amazing. Pictured are the water beetles, chicken sandwich, and kale salad. I enjoyed the salad. My friend bravely enjoyed the beetles and said they were pretty tasty.', 'So very fun collection of international street food. \\xa0Casual and easy. \\xa0The South African curry is great comfort food and the spicy wings are a treat for the eyes as well as delicious. \\xa0The French Tacos got a great rave as well. \\xa0Only complaint is if you are going to sell wine in a bistro glass then sell bistro style and priced wines.', \"Got the tea leaf salad - laphet thoke. The taste is not that good - too salty for me. But what's shocking is the quantity. I thought I got a side salad box by mistake. I literally called them to make sure!! The side salad box is also not even half full. I don't understand how this can be 20$ and why this place got such high stars. Maybe this particular thing was a wrong choice!\", 'Their prices went up and their food and service quality went down. They also implemented a 20% automatic tip for EVERYONE! Even if its just a party of two shoved in a corner. I ordered the mcnguyen \\xa0cause the name was just ridiculous. It was disgusting. I told the server i didnt like it and he said well thats just the way we make it! I can get you something else but im still gonna charge you for the mcnguyen. Thats $16 for a cocktail I hated. The prices are generally wayyy too high for what the dish is, but the shakshuka is hilariously overpriced. $19 for three eggs laid on top of tomato sauce and 4 small pieces of flatbread that was simultaneously cold and burnt.', 'After much unnecessary waiting for an opportunity to dine at this popular restaurant, I finally took the bait and tried it, and am so glad I did. many of my friends and work colleagues talked about this place, and although some reviews were mixed, overall people really seemed to enjoy the food and ambiance.I tried the pineapple cornbread, which was vegetarian, which I loved. I am a minimal carnivore with a strong preference for the herbivore lifestyle. The cornbread did not disappoint. it was sweet but not overly sweat. The cornbread was moist and very satisfying. I also had the Syrian kale salad, and let me just say that the pomegranate dressing tasted so heavenly. the salad was crisp and fresh and very satisfying. I left the restaurant feeling satiated and very satisfied with my experience.I will certainly be back for seconds!', \"A must try if you are ever in the Capitol Hill area. As a visitor from LA, I am drawn to authentic Asian fusion, and this venue hits home. Seating was made easy due to the available waitlist. The place was pretty packed around dinner time. Other than the amount of time it took for our food to arrive, I have complaints about the quality of the food and the flavor of each dish. Be sure to try the McNguyen, wish I ordered more! Parking can be tricky, but once you snag a street space, it's an easy walk to the restaurant!\", \"Staff were dressed in crop tops and uggs and spent every second that they werent serving just loudly laughing and talking right next to our table. For the price of the food, it was extremely unprofessional and dissapointing. They weren't particularly kind either.\", 'This place was so quirky and cute. I loved the decor, the food and the servers. Everything was lovely. We ordered the Balinese Sate Lilet , Pakistani Peshawari Chapli Kabab (Halal) and the Syrian Kale & Carrot Salad. Every single item was bursting with flavor. Delicious. Will visit again and definitely recommend this place to all my friends.', \"Love every dish I've ever had here. Truly a wonderful atmosphere. Servers are always kind, a very welcoming environment.\", 'Came here for brunch at 11:30 on a Saturday, and luckily were seated right away. All three of us got something different and everything was so delicious. I had the Filipino Tosilog and 10/10 would recommend.', 'Food was solid but not amazing.The service was really bad.We got 3 dishes and it was good that we were sharing because it\\'s not possible for them to serve anything at the same time. The second dish came out after we finished the first which was fine, but 20 mins after we finished our second dish the third dish (Brussels sprouts) hadn\\'t come out yet. We asked a waitress and she was like \"uhhh I\\'m not your server, do you know who it was?\" and we weren\\'t sure so she was like \"ok I\\'ll check on that for you\". 5-10 minutes later she hasn\\'t come back. Another waiter comes by and brings us the bill and it included the third dish. We were ready to leave at that point and honestly who wants to eat brussel sprouts on its own? So we\\'re like just cancel the third dish. The waiter was really rude and insisted we can\\'t cancel because the third dish was already being made and almost ready, despite handing us the bill with it on before we even got it. The waiter insisted we take the brussel sprouts to go. After I said \"dude who serves a dish 30 minutes after the last plate was done and then tells us to take the last dish to go \" The waiter was like \"fine, I\\'ll take it off the bill. But we\\'re clearly really busy *gestures at other tables*\"', \"Perfection.Avoided the wait by sitting at the bar and our party of four was seated immediately. We ordered a bit of everything- cornbread, kebabs, curry, hot wings, and kale salad. The restaurant theme is global street food and we tried dishes from Jamaica, Pakistan, Syria, Malaysia and Thailand. Food was delicious and the service at the bar was exceptional! Love the vibes and the food!They mostly take reservations and we were initially told when we arrived at 6:30pm on a Saturday night that we could come back in three hours or hope one of their reservations canceled (?!?!). The thing is, there were a ton of empty tables! As we are leaving the host then suggests the bar which has four empty seats available immediately which we happily took. Throughout our meal we noticed that most of the restaurant was sitting empty waiting on reservations. Their system isn't working so they really should keep a couple tables open for walk-ins.\", \"Eclectic restaurant with a variety of good food ! We got the Chengdu chicken wings and the ribs and honestly, \\xa0it's hard to pick a favorite.We also had a couple of cocktails that were interesting but not the best.\", \"We loved all the foodWe got the Sunny Bunny, Channa and aloo, Chengdu chicken and waffles, and the Iranian shakshuka.The only issue we had was that the water glasses didn't seem to be the cleanest but they provided us with new ones once we asked. The Mo' Mosa carafe also had some black crumbs in it.\", \"This is a gem of Seattle food was really tasty and the cocktails are very tasty.. can't wait till I can eat indoors.\", \"Really delicious dinner. I had the Brussels sprouts (vegan if you don't use the aioli) and the Burmese Laphet Thoke (vegan) and both were really yummy. The tea leaf salad had really nice texture with crunch and delicious flavor. The Trinidadian curry also looked like a great vegan option. My partner got a chicken sandwich and was also pleased, though it seems like it was missing something such as a side which I guess you could order separately but the cost of that seems a bit much. I think some additional options would be good but I'd like to come back and try the couple other options I can!\", \"This was a great little spot to grab lunch with my Nephew on a sunny seattle summer day. The menu offered \\xa0a unique mixture of different flavors and foods from around the globe. The menu was a bit limited, but according to the website it changes often. We have the pineapple cornbread- very reminiscent of cornbread I've had in Jamaica- that was moist, flavorful and topped with toasted coconut. Next was the Gujarati Brussels crispy and topped with chutney. The Brussels sprouts were delicious and I really enjoyed the sweet and sour dipping sauce- I LOVE curry aioli normally, but idk if it was the aioli or the combo of the items, I wasn't a big fan. The was had the Chengdu chicken and waffles- this is a must have! The chicken was fabulous and well waffles! How can you go wrong?!?!What a great idea for a restaurant... To have really good food from around the world. Just a few items at a time so that it's made well.\", \"Scrolling down on yelp & seen this place. We got seated right away & the server light up \\xa0heaters. \\xa0She was very acknowledged & helpful as well. We ordered \\xa0season fries, kale salad, fried chicken on stick.

Would highly recommend as a brunch spot with friends or by oneself!', 'It really didn\\'t help with the first impression when our water bottle arrived with a red pepper stuck deep inside. Individual dishes are pretty tasty, but overall I cannot understand the theme of the restaurant. It feels like they took a random dish from random cuisines and put it all together in an attempt to make a \"fusion\" restaurant.Also, the insect and reptile infused alcohol seems like a tourist trap. It doesn\\'t taste good nor does it provide an experience. Not sure if I\\'d come back.', 'Definitely make a reservation if coming during peak hours. Fortunately I had made one a couple of days in advance at noon as no open seats were available until close to 1 PM.Inside is dimly lit and crowded due to the small space. I ended up being squished between two parties on a long table. Their dishes are pricey for the amount of food served, but are rather special in its flavors.-----Tower of Chengdu Wings: double-dipped, crispy fried wings and drumsticks with green Szechuan peppercorn, fish sauce, lime, chili, basil, Thai chili, and mint ($18).The tower came with a stack of freshly fried 3 chicken wings and 3 drumsticks. The sour smell was unexpected, but the combination of the spiciness, sweetness, and sourness was tasty. I also liked how well the basil and sauce paired with the chicken! And it isn\\'t hot unless you decide to eat the sliced Thai chili peppers.If coming for dinner, this dish is instead listed on the menu as \"Chengdu Spicy Jumbo Chicken Wings\" for the same price. A bowl for discarding bones as well as two wet wipes are provided.-----', \"We dined here for the first time visiting Seattle. It's a small place so I was very impressed that they take reservations.

But the best of the best was something I haven't seen here in the states, water bugs, and was so surprised to see them served here in Seattle! 5 stars all around, cool ambiance, unique food, great flavors and professional service\", \"This restaurant definitely lives up to the eclectic vibe. It's unique in every aspect. Their take on fried chicken is like none you've ever had. The barbecue ribs are a must, slow cooked to perfection. The meat literally fell off the bone with every bite. All in all it was a solid experience.\", \"This decor of this place is so unique looking...it's also very small and you sit at a long shared table. Loved the concept of this restaurant - street foods from around the world! Pineapple cornbread- I usually don't like cornbread. But loved how moist this bread was. East Indies Brussels sprouts- omg so good! Wonderfully cooked with coconut flakes and delicious peanut and sweet chili dipping sauces. A must try! South African Bunny Chow- curry in a large bread bowl. Pretty tasty but the bread was kinda hard and tough to cut. Chengdu Fried Chicken Wing Tower- love theses spicy fish sauce wings. Perfectly crispy even with the tangy sauce. Just be careful to not bite into a pepper!Balinese Spare Ribs- this one is also really tasty, great sauce. But quite expensive. Brazilian Acaraje- my least favorite dish of the night. In comparison it seemed to lack as much flavor as the other dishes.I'd recommend a quick (dining) trip around the world at Nue!\", 'For those who are gluten free, the South African sunny bunny comes with rice and not bread.

I highly recommend trying this one!', 'our first stop in seattle while visiting for fall break. internationally inspired brunch, with a twist on global street food faves likes filipino tosilog and japanese katsu sandos! shared two plates: 1. chengdu chicken and waffles: green szechuan peppercorn, fish sauce, lime, thai chili, mint with waffles + maple syrup FYE 2. filipino tosilog: house made tocino, garlic, fried rice, soy/chili vinegar with a side of eggs - another banger so good we came back for a second meal before we left seattle', \"Possibly our single most favorite restaurant in Seattle! The creativity at Nue is unbeaten; flavor and presentation are 10/10 for sure! The inside of the restaurant is small, though if it is a nice day they do offer outdoor seating as well, which helps! Courses are meant for sharing, so it's a great way to sample a lot of the menu. They pace the plates well, never letting you sit with nothing for long, though also not bombarding you with 10 dishes at a time. My husband still talks about Nue even though we've been home for weeks, so you KNOW it's great!\", 'This has become one of my favorite spots in the city - I am sad that I just discovered this place and not before. I visited during COVID-19 but they had outdoor seating to accommodate. My favorite dishes on the menu were the south african bunny chow and the chengdu spicy jumbo chicken wings. The bunny chow was made of chicken breast immersed in flavorful indian masalas. Personally, I am a big fan of chicken wings and I make it a point to try it at a restaurant if they offer it. This is easily one of the best ones I have had the chance to savor.', 'Okay, yum!!!!!! What a delicious and exciting place to eat. I really enjoyed the intriguing and adventurous (at least for me) dishes and boisterous, yet intimate ambience. The cocktails are also great! The dish that really stood out for me was the chicken wings, they were so crunchy and tender and flavorful. My only qualm is that the service was a bit slow. Overall I loved it and would return.', 'Went here for weekend brunch and got the Filipino Tosilog, Israeli Shakshouka, and Chengdu Wings. The tosilog was solid, if not a bit basic. The Shakshouka was delicious, and the wings were also awesome with the perfect amount of spiciness. I would come back again for the wings and shakshouka.', \"I've been a few times and the menu changes which is cool. I've enjoyed everything I've eaten here so far! The puerto divan mofongo when it was on the menu was divine, I recently had the Gujarati style brussel sprouts, French tacos and the Cambodian curry and they were all fantastic! Such unique and yummy flavors. This is a great restaurant for worldly eats!\", \"Came for brunch. The kale salad was the show stealer. The chicken and waffles was very 'gramable but was just okay. Joined the waitlist on Yelp which we learned actually means sitting outside. The service was also just okay. I would expect bottomless coffee to be filled throughout the meal.\", \"Such a cool place for brunch! I love restaurants that really deliver on a novel menu and Nue is one of those. We grabbed a reservation for a Sunday morning. Can I get a high five for actually having the option to reserve a table on a weekend morning?! The food was out quick and it was incredibly delicious. It was so hard to choose from the diverse menu so we'll have to be back. The shakshuka is awesome and you should grab a slice of coconut corn bread too.One note: This place is loud -- open kitchen, industrial ceiling, communal tables, so not ideal for an intimate affair. But if you're hanging with friends and don't mind rubbing elbows with strangers, head on over!\", \"Honestly, this place is really hyped up but I thought it was only OK.My waffles were limp. Fried chicken was good, but hard to go wrong with fried chicken. War fries were good but they're fries with Mayo sauces on them - if they weren't they'd be something terribly wrong.Only really interesting things I had were the Calamansi limeade which was delicious and unusual and the pineapple cornbread which was novel but very small. Checked this off my to-do Seattle list, won't come again.Might I also add that we had a noon reservation, told them we had a dog and needed to be outside but they forgot and we had to wait 40 min for an outside table. :(Service was really friendly though.\", \"LOOOVED this place! The blend of flavors and ingredients made for some of the best unconventional dishes I've ever had. Will definitely be coming back! Kale salad was SO good too!\", 'Seated quickly without a reservation. Food is amazing had Israeli Shakshura & Filipino Tosling. Had Less Mosa & New Fashioned.

My favorite dish out of the three surprisingly was the Shakshouka! It was the best one I've had compared to many other places! Also the roti that came out with the curry was perfection! So much goodness, it was soft, crispy, chewy, and buttery, mmm yum :) Wish the wings were a little bit less sweet.

(thai water beetles for example). It does get pretty busy here, so I recommend reservations especially during peak hours. The ambience feels like a relaxed upscale bar/eatery, and the service was great! You'll find dishes at a slightly higher price point while the portions arent lacking. Their menu actually rotates so its always fun coming back to see what other things are on the menu. I've been back a few times and I've always left satisfied! I highly recommend checking this spot out, and it even doubles as a great date spot - there are other spots nearby to check out to keep the day going!\", 'One word for this place... Amazing!!!I am a breakfast lover and I appreciate when restaurants do Brunch right.The brunch menu is so unique ... we wanted to try everything.We ordered the chicken and waffles: the waffles were perfectly done... so fluffy. the chicken was crunchy and had a spicy kick to it.We also ordered the Filipino Tosilog... fried rice like no other ... the cured pork was perfectly balanced between sweet and spicy. I loved the combination of flavors.. amazing.', 'South African bunny chow is amazing and their desserts. Very eclectic ambiance and great service overall', \"The African chicken wings are like that one girl you dated in high school 'straight ridiculous'.Line was a bit long but if your willing to wait it's worth it.\", \"I went looking for flavor and got unseasoned and pretty flat food instead unfortunately. The chapli kebabs were more beef patties for a double cheeseburger and less packed with peshawari flavors that were described. While the menu is promising the food overall is very muted. They need to 10x the flavor to give people what they're looking for when they want Asian cuisine.\", \"I just want to start off by saying Nue made a believer out of me. I've basically been a lifelong vegetarian with a severe dislike of salads and even more so, KALE. I can honestly say that the kale salad here was delicious and I loved every bite of it! That being said, I was a bit bummed out that they ran out of fries when we went by which is why I settled upon kale salad as my dish of choice. The interior is eclectic and definitely has a lot of eye candy to stare at as you munch away. My friends enjoyed their food and we had a great time overall. Seems like a solid place to grab some food if you are in the area.\", \"Amaaaazing food! Loved the fried Brussel sprouts (probably best I've had) and the yellow curry sauce was yum. The Trinidadian curry was absolutely delicious and filling. Some of the best roti I've had. Quality fresh food. The fries topped with red onions and peanut sauce? didn't really catch my attention though; and I'm a lover of fries, so I think it was just okay. I love that the menu pulls in cuisines and ingredients from various countries from Trinidad, Philippines, Burma, India--to name some. Friendly service and great quality food. The non-alcoholic calamansi drink was refreshing as well. Outdoor dining available. Definitely recommend a stop and try here :).

We never received water refills, the food took way longer than necessary, and sat on the counter for a while until being brought out, the waiter never came back after the initial order, while multiple people were sitting around inside.

They have dishes from around the world but my personal favs at Brunch are the Tosliog, Pineapple Cornbread, or Chicken and Waffles. While for lunch/dinner, I'd go with Bali Ribs, Sunny Bunny, pig tails or the wings. All of which I have vetted multiple times and the quality is always perfect! All of these dishes are so flavorful and bring something different to the table. They also have an ~interesting~ menu where you can try the beetles and balut if you're an adventurous eater! There's something for everyone here. I really love this place and love how they've executed -- from the cool decor and great service to the even better food. Really glad to have this spot in Cap Hill!\", 'Came here for brunch while I was visiting Seattle. Atmosphere was chill and food was good, great spot for a midday meal', \"My mom found this place while we were visiting Seattle for a weekend, and I don't regret coming here at all.First, the service was great. I forgot to book an appointment so we had to sit outside. However, the server we had turned on our heating right away and checked on us enough to be helpful, but not so much that it was overbearing. She came just the perfect amount.We ordered the South African Bunny Chow, Chengdu Fried Chicken, and the Sheshuka. Something I noticed is that everything here is big on flavor.The Fried Chicken wasn't my favorite due to the strong spices, but it's a unique flavor and I would try eating it once. My parents loved it, so it could just be personal taste.The Sheshuka had a very fresh taste and worked really well with the bread it came with. The Bunny Chow was my personal favorite, and everything from the presentation to the flavor was excellent. I enjoyed the flavors that came out of it, but it's just a spectacle to see. The savoriness and earthy flavor of the bunny chow worked really well with the sheshuka so I would definitely order the two together.Overall, if I lived in the area, I can see myself coming to this place regularly.\", \"I've been coming to this place regularly for the past year and am impressed every time. The Service was beyond phenomenal. Our server made us feel right at home and gave us excellent food recommendations. And compliments to the chefs! You can see the cooks from where you sit and you can just tell their working incredibly hard to accommodate how busy this place can get. The ribs and the Chengdu wings are a MUST try. Sometimes theres a wait but just be patient because it is soooo worth it\", \"Visiting Seattle and saw this restaurant had good reviews so we gave it a try. Food was pretty bad. Service was worse despite the restaurant being half empty. Too much going on here with the cuisine... Sat through an entire dinner without water while our server was no where to be found. If you're looking for a unique dining experience in Seattle - look elsewhere.\", 'Not one complaint other then tight seating and semi slow service but it was delicious meal and the waitresses/waiters are sweet', \"Had takeout for birthday dinner from Nue and what a surprise it was! Excellent food, deep flavors and the quality is outstanding. These folks clearly know what they are doing. The ribs and wings were out of this world, but our favorite thing had to be the Irish kale mashed potatoes. I've never had mashed potatoes this good and fluffy! Will definitely order again, incredibly happy to support local business that are owned and operated by women. More businesses can learn from Nue - Watch out Seattle, there's a new flavor queen in town!\", \"Amazing food! Went in on a last minute group dinner and this place did not disappoint. Great atmosphere, cute drink menu, and tons of eclectic options. You shouldn't second guess coming and trying it out.\", \"Besides the purpose and relatable story behind the restaurant that originally drew me and my girlfriend in to Nue for our anniversary, I'm happy that the food is amazing as well. It'll be hard to find the variety of dishes (from around the World) and the level they are brought to at Nue anywhere else in Washington. We had the ribs that literally fell off of the bone when picking it up, and the Seattle Food Week menu. The full course + an app + another entree left us with 3 Togo boxes, so portions are NOT an issue. We'll be revisiting Nue again soon!\", \"If you judge a place by its fries, well then run. But if you enjoy eating fries cooked in 3 month old oil, this is your spot. Soggy Cubans, look no further. Servers that sit and chat while you've been waiting for your drinks for literally 20min. Stop on by. And no, they were not understaffed, 3-4 servers and only 6 tables. Worst of all they could tell we were having a terrible experience and couldn't have been less concerned. I was a chef and also have 5 years of server experience and there is just not much good I can say about this place other than their fried chicken was really good. Nonetheless, The pictures and reviews are very deceiving.\", 'Food was pretty good and ambience was great but overall things were really expensive..We got: - malaysia curry 9/10: flavors were really good!! And the roti was yummm- chengdu chicken tower 9/10: i really liked the crispy skin and the flavors were also a great balance of sweet and savory (&slightly spicy as well)', 'Great variety of food, the Chengdu chicken wings and Kabuli burger are finger licking good, interesting choice of cocktails. The decor also got a cozy feel, will go back for more soon', \"Mind blowing. Really. The menu is super eclectic, ambiance is very hippy and cozy. Friendly servers. The cocktails and drinks were innovative too. We went for dinner and had the Chengdu Wings and it was a gastronomical delight. I can't really place the herbs used .. but it was perfectly balanced flavors. Highly highly recommended. What a great find. Must visit for all Seattle visitors.\", 'The menu for weekday brunch was somewhat limited, but my two companions and I each got something different and they were all amazing.', \"SO SO impressed with the food here! Each and everything was so yummmm!Order of preference for dishes:- South African Bunny Chow- Trinidadian Goat Curry- Cambodian Salor Kari Sap Curry- Balinese Sate Lilet (nothing super)Again, everything was mind blowing so try to go on a double date so you can try all that you can ;) There is no model of apps vs main course, just order what you're in the mood for, like a small plates model. Everything is shareable.They have indoor and outdoor seating but we made a reservation for saturday at 7pm about 3 days in advance and got lucky with indoor seating on a cold rainy night.\", \"Ordered:Katsu sando-baddddd it was dryyyy. \\xa0Not juicy and yummy like the ones I've had before.Tower of wings-it was really juicy. \\xa0Also had really good flavors. \\xa0It was very basil-y, sweet, peppery, and spicy because it had Thai chili's on it. Id rec ordering this!\", \"4.5/5Really good food here and I want to try everything on the menu. Got the Pineapple Cornbread and the Fried Chicken. I love cornbread and this one is on the top of the list. I think personally, I'd prefer it to be slightly more moist, but it is still great. The Fried Chicken has an amazing texture and is really crispy. The spices made the flavors stand out a lot. The chicken was juicy too which made me happy since I try too much fried chicken that is ruined by being overcooked and too dry. I love the décor here since it is fun to explore all these collections of things they have there. Very colorful and fun.\", \"Seriously wow! This place is bomb!! We made reservations as there's limited seating in the restaurant. Overall food and drinks were really good. Highly highly recommend.\", \"Terrible customer service, don't expect them to treat you right. Will never come back.\", \"Zero stars. The service is horrible. We are an hour and half into service and still don't have food. The waitress asked what we ordered then said she forgot to put the order on. Skip this place they are unorganized and space cadets.UPDATE:The hostess was kind enough to offer us a free round of drinks later to find out we were charged for them.\", 'An adventure for your tastebuds! \\xa0Loved the ability to mix different cuisines in a fun and casual setting.', \"Writing this review based on my experience in August of 2017- based on memory and my photos. We were seated easily and promptly around 830, along the bar facing out to the street. It does get busy, and the space is cozy, so prepare to squeeze in- well worth it for an excellent meal.We had a kale & carrot salad, the Chengdu jumbo chicken wing tower, a rich curry & rice, and the fried brussel sprouts. Everything tasted great, however, I would have loved a bit more guidance on what to order for our party size of 2. Service was prompt and friendly, and I'll surely have to visit again to see what has changed.\", 'Incredible food. I mean creative, delicious, superlative cuisine. Service was phenomenal. My only gripe is they need a bigger space!', 'Very small unique restaurant full of character. The wings are to die for. Just do it and get you a tower of heaven on a delicious plate. The service was fast and super efficient. The wait was extremely long, but they kept us updated the whole time.', \"I'll keep this short: the food was really bad. Got the chengdu chicken and friend got a rice dish, both tasted offensively bad, and they were like 15 bucks each. I'm not even exaggerating when I say the chicken made me gag at every bite -- but I wasn't going to throw away a 15 dollar meal. Also got a cocktail drink that was just.... Awful. It tasted like bile / stomach acid. I am really surprised that this place has four stars -- one of the worst places I've been to.\", \"Saw good reviews and came to this place for late lunch. It's like an Asian fusion place or at least the decor gives out that vibe. Ordered the ribs which was good and tender. However, the rice that it came with was dry or undercooked. Prices are on the high side, $33 for 5 PCs of small ribs. Servers were not very attentive even though they weren't busy. Offered us a piece of their cornbread as compensation for the failed rice. Cornbread was warm but salty! Are cornbreads supposed to be salty? This place runs like a hip place with hip servers, but food was hit or miss, and service was very cold. Will not go again when I visit Seattle.\", \"This is the place if you want something neu for a change. You could basically travel the world and try a variety of cuisines from this little restaurant in one fell swoop. The restaurant is rather small so you might have to burst your personal space bubble before sitting down at the community table.The food is pretty delicious. Balinese BBQ spared ribs are rich in flavor and tender in texture. Brazilian Acaraje is like ice-cream sandwiches with savory filling. There's a familiar taste to dry shrimp in Asian cuisine I find in this Brazilian dish.Their drinks are pretty decent and as diverse as their food.I was advised against the Bunny Chow and the Chicken Wings, so I didn't have a chance to try them. Bring a group of friends so you can sample more dishes.\", \"We had a great family style dinner with all of the vegetarian options at Nue. I had been here 3 years ago and don't remember there being as many vegetarian options so I really appreciated the updated menu! We got the Syrian Kale & Carrot Salad which was perfect in cooling us down during the heat wave and the Gujarati Style Brussels Sprouts which came with flavorful chutneys! We also had to get Pineapple Cornbread and Cambodian Salor Kari Sap Curry, both of which we devoured! When I saw Malva Pudding on the menu, I knew I had to get after how much I loved it in South Africa. It was very rich and orangey!\", \"First time coming to Nue and it was for brunch. Ordered the Filipino Tosilog, very delicious! This is something that I do eat at home but in my opinion it has a different twist to it. But oh so good. Also ordered the War Chips which were unbelievably tasty. During brunch they have mimosas which you can order by glass($10) or 32oz for $20. Obviously ordered the 32oz because that's a bangin deal. And if you're with some friends you can spilt that cost which comes down to like nothing. Definitely would recommend trying Nue\", \"Not as good as it once was. Serve was good all things considered. The restaurant hasn't a clue what it wants to be. The dishes are fine with a few exceptionally good dishes (chicken wings and mash potatoes). The first course doesn't flow naturally into the next one. The menu is like the chefs favorite dishes and only sort of knows. World travel in a single dinner is great, if you cook well and have a thought out menu but Nue doesn't.I am all for having bugs on the menu but they are so overpriced and just taste bad (I've had amazingly good but not at Nue).\", \"- best service, left 30% tips, it's that good, really attentive - chengdu chicken was sweet & savory(甜味麻椒味），waffles are airy- bunny curry bread was really tasty!!- small place, limited tables - coffee was pretty bad....\", 'This was good stuff! We got the bunny chow and Malaysian curry and it was all excellent! The curry and roti reminded me of the food I ate when I was a child back in Singapore The Viet coffee is good too if you need a caffeine fix!', \"They do have a pretty exciting weekend brunch menu, with dishes from all six continents and mix of different cultures. \\xa0It's gimmicky, but effective. I like their spin on the chicken and waffle. \\xa0Fish sauce chicken wings have always been good with rice at home. \\xa0I never knew it could go so well with maple syrup and waffle. \\xa0They keep the batter light and don't hold back on the fish sauce, so cheers to them.I'm disappointed in the bunny chow. \\xa0The chicken is overcooked and not tender at all. \\xa0The curry mix tastes strange; it doesn't have much warmth or aroma, and adding fresh tomato doesn't help. \\xa0The bread holding the curry is tough. \\xa0So is the fries.So, brunch is kind of a mixed-bag. \\xa0I'm waffling between three and four stars. \\xa0The fish sauce wings prevail, so a grudging four stars it is.\", \"This flavorful gem in cap hill will put your tastebuds to a tingly satisfactory destination. The bunny chow is simple but so goood idk how the bread and the curry on top go so well together! The wings here are on another level- warning they are spicy so if that's not your thing, idk what to tell ya.The Bali ribs are fall off the bone, a bit dry which I prefer so I can dip them in sauce. All in all, even with covid they have tents outside with heating to eat in. Definitely make a Rezzy so you can be seated. Also they sell boozy popsicles, a fun way of getting tipsy lol\", \"My friend was having her birthday brunch here on a Sunday. We filled up half the restaurant which is not hard if you have been and seen the size. The decor is kind of hard for me to describe but I will do my best. On one side of the restaurant there is the kitchen. On the other side there is a wall with selves and piles of random stuff. If I would have done my research I probably would be able to speak more to it. If you are a neat freak, you probably will not enjoy looking at your surroundings. But if you love a theme and stuff, you'll probably love it.The menu which you probably have seen pictures of is filled with dishes form all over the world. I ended up with the Filipino Tosilog which is pretty predictable for me since I enjoy asian food and it usually is my go to. On the side I also ordered the Dutch Patat Oorlog (War chips). I am a sucker for fries anywhere on the menu.The Tocino was really good. I could have ate double the portion on my plate. The rice on the other hand was kind of bland and crunchier than I prefer. I also tried a bite of the Puerto Rican Mofongo and now that I am thinking about it, I want to go back to have some more.There are several dishes on this menu that I would like to try. They have a whole bunch of variety and it is a pretty cool place to eat. The checks come out in travelers books from different places around the world to match some of the places the dishes are from which is a nice fun touch to go with the restaurant's theme.One day I will probably end up back here. Would definitely recommend this place to adventurers people, people who love food, trying different culture's food, etc.P.S. The staff is very friendly and accommodating which is also a plus if you are looking to bring a large group here.\", \"Came here for Sunday brunch. \\xa0We got great seats at the window bench, facing out on to the street. \\xa0The service was friendly and fast.We had:the chicken wings - they were excellent, crisped perfectly, with the accompanying spice. \\xa0I could have tolerated a little more heat, but otherwise no complaints.south african sunny bunny - this was amazing. \\xa0It was flavorful, filling and a generous sized portion. \\xa0The combo of the curry, egg and bread was perfect. I would definitely recommend.Cornbread - One of their specialties. \\xa0Get it. \\xa0It's a great nibbler to have on the side when you eat your entree.To drink, I had the Korean Michelada. \\xa0It was interesting. \\xa0Very light (the Korean beer they use is not as strong as a beer such as Modelo). \\xa0The nice kick of acid in the drink balanced the heavy wings and sunny bunny.Overall, a wonderful brunch. \\xa0I would highly recommend!\", \"I've been wanting to visit this place for some time and I'm glad I did today! I went during lunch time around 12:45pm and there were lots of tables available. Parking was street parking but pretty easy to find in the afternoon. The first thing I noticed was the unique interior. It reminded me of a Hawaiian hut of some sort. The restaurant def has a lot of things going on so I didn't mind waiting for our foods since I was distracted with the interior. My bf and I ordered the Tower of Chengdu wings ($18), Japanese katsu Sando ($12) and war chips ($10). I would consider this place quite pricy since it cost $18 for just 6 wings. Personally the wings were not my cup of tea because it had a strong basil taste to it. Don't get me wrong, it was still good with a sweet, spicy, and sour taste all in one but I could only eat two. The Japanese katsu Sando was just bad for me. My bf agreed because the katsu was too hard and barely had any flavor. The sauce they used was sweet but almost tasted like ketchup. I took two bites and that's all I could eat. The fries however were 10/10, my bf and I were fighting to finish the last pieces lolI ordered the war chips (fries) because I wasn't full and it was sadly alright. The fries are covered in garlic mayo, sweet red onion, some kind of gravy and sambal. I visit Southeast Asia a lot so I know what sambal taste like and it wasn't anything like it. It tasted like sriracha. The fries itself was good but I was confused with the taste. It had a lot of flavors going on, sweet from the onions, creamy from the mayo, gravy looking sauce was very sweet (thought it was caramel at first lol) and the samba was salty and sweet. Maybe because I was hungry, I enjoyed the first few bites and then later on I was eating the plain fries. As mentioned, this restaurant is a little pricy but the menu is very enticing, offering a lot of different kinds of selections. I would come back again because I want to try their other food. Service was pretty good though a little slow. \\xa0FYI, a 20% service charge is included so we ended up paying around $53 for three plates.\", \"This place was uber crowded at around 7:30pm on a Monday evening. My gf and I were seated next to two parties on a communal table; everyone was friendly.We ordered two dishes that was enough for us: Brazilian Acarajé, Fluffy Fritters made from Peeled, Black Eyed Peas fried, and stuffed with spices and prawns. This was tasty with lime!Trinidadian Doubles: open faced flatbreads topped w/ curry and Chickpeas w/ Relish, Trinidadian Hot Sauce, Tamarind Chutney, Cucumber Relish & Cilantro. Picture these are tacos as they came in threes per dish. Scrumptious! Would come here again to try their other dishes as our neighbor's food looks absolutely appetizing! I docked off a star because this place is quite expensive for the portion sizes.\", \"Cool atmosphere, good service, pretty good food (got the cambodian curry). The only thing I didn't love was that our table was super close to the next table, and it was a bit tricky to get in and out.\", \"I had the black eye peas, plantains, and rice. It was so good. But I don't think they have it on the menu anymore. It was delicious!\", \"Delicious. Ordered and enjoyed nearly everything on the happy hour menu. Especially recommend the Brussels and the Kale and Carrot Salad. Really loved that the menu clearly states what items are vegetarian/vegan. Show up, order food to share with your friends, order more because it's so good, leave full and happy.\", 'Loved this place, I had the coconut cornbread it was so good went back with my wife had a very entertaining meal the atmosphere was lively a diverse mixture of culture s it wAs place to meet people great food from around the world', \"To be honest, I wasn't completely impressed with Nue. The service wasn't that great, we had to constantly flag down a worker for more water and she even forgot our drink orders twice. We had to ask how come our food came out before our beer! Haha. The Grub. [[ South African Bunny Chow $20 ]] This dish was pretty bomb. It was served with Chicken Breast, Indian Masala, Lime, Cilantro and served in a bread bowl. [[ East Indies Brussel Sprouts $11 ]] The Brussel sprouts were cooked perfectly. Crispy fried sprouts in coconut and garlic chutney. Winner!\", 'Fun restaurant in Cap Hill!So cool that they have food from all over the world in one place! \\xa0Thai meets Turkish meets Portuguese...The Istanbul style wet burger was amazing. The cocktails were all fun and tasty. \\xa0Highly recommend!', 'This place is good but I am taking off a star because it is not consistent. I really enjoy their chicken wings but the flavor and consistency of the sauce is not consistent. The first time I tried it, the sauce was sticky and thickened but the second time, it was runny. I enjoyed the wings better the first time. I also really enjoy their corn bread. It comes with coconut on top and i usually just scrape it off : ) My friend mentioned that the bunny chow was very good. Just an fyi, no actual bunnies are used in the dish; I think its chicken. They also serve water beetles which really creeps me out. Someone that tried it said it smells like flowers. EEEEE!!!', 'Was recommended this place by a friend because they saw it appear on TV. So we went, you basically need to make reservations, though when we got there we were disappointment because the place is small and tables are right next to exporter so you literally have a stranger sitting next to you.Dood was alright, but they could make taste a lot better', \"Horrible management, period. We got booked for a reservation at a later time per their request. We show up and they then tell us they don't have a reservation then proceeded to tell us about how we inconvenienced them... when they're the ones the set the reservation for us. Maybe the food is good but who knows\", \"Interesting food, $5 too expensive per item. \\xa0Overall the food was very tasty and not your normal items you'd find elsewhere. \\xa0You will have fun exporing different tastes from around the world all in one spot. \\xa0However, everything seemed to be priced about $5 too high to make this a regular spot for us. \\xa0Drinks were $13 and we were sitting outside on a metal folding chair. \\xa0I expect to pay that price at a swanky built out space. \\xa0And the food was delicious (as I said) but a bit pricey like $18 for a shredded lettuce/cabbage salad. \\xa0As for the outdoor dining, they are doing their best (really, they are!) but we found it to be too cold at this time of year (Feb) to really enjoy ourselves. \\xa0The metal folding chairs were not a great choice as they conduct the cold too well and we found ourselves standing up regularly to give our bottoms a break from the cold metal. \\xa0I would suggest adding a pad for this time of year.Still gave it a 4 stars because it is so different and worth a try for every adventurous eater out there!\", 'This spot was bookmarked on my list for MONTHS. Did not disappoint. The chicken was amazing and would go again. The interior decor and bill design -- creative! Love it!', 'this 1 start review is for Gil, our waiter. Just was not impressed with his service. Other than that, food was good though.', \"I nue it from the get-go that this place will deliver a unique dining experience! We made reservations but the place accepts walk-ins as well. There are limited indoor seatings. They can accomodate up to 24 people at the 2 communal tables, 4-6 people on window counter, and roughly 8-10 people at the bar. Be prepared to be packed in like sardines if the place gets busy. As I walked in, I couldn't help but peruse the eye-catching memorabilia from different countries being put on display. Lovely! We ordered: *South African Bunny ChowHold your horses! Contrary to the name, it's not a dish made of sweet little bunnies but rather chicken curry served in a pullman bread bowl. Curry was aromatic, chicken was tender, and bread bowl was perfectly toasted. Love it! *Balinese Barbequed Spare RibsI grew up eating Balinese style spare ribs and this ain't it. The glaze used for this ribs is a different type of glaze Balinese use on grilled fish. The overall flavor was alright but just didn't sit well with us who are so used to the authentic Balinese ribs. Priced at $35, I wouldn't get it again. *Chengdu Spicy Jumbo Chicken WingsNot only did they look good, but they also tasted AMAZE-WING! They were bold with nice sweet peppery kick. My only gripe was that on two of the pieces that I had, the meat was slightly tough but the rest of them was juicy and tender. *South African Chocolate MalvaBaked pudding bathed in warm chocolate sauce and topped with coffee liqueur whipped cream. The texture was slightly spongy like cake but also delicate like pudding. Chocolate sauce was decadent but not too overwhelming. The whipped cream was surprisingly very light and flavorful. Overall, just WOW. It was my first encounter with this dessert and it certainly won't be the last!Service was friendly and accommodating. Food took quite a while to come out but understandable since it was a busy night. All in all, would return to try other dishes!\", 'Such a neat concept for a restaurant in a cozy intimate space. Everything we tried was good but the ribs were hands down our favorite w the wings coming in a close second. 3/4 stars for all the other food, 5 stars for the ribs, wings, service and ambiance.', \"It's quite an interesting place with a mix of trendy street food around the globe. Eclectic concept and decor in the room. Ordered:South African Bunny chow Burmese Laplet Toke(tea leaf salad)Filipino Tosilog brunch Chengdu Spicy Chicken wings The receipt was enclosed with a travel log book And NUE got me! I'm going to Chile/Peru next year\", 'Space: 3 long communal tables and 1 table along the windows. They definitely make use of their space so it\\'s a bit cramp, so just know that you shouldnt mind sitting across from your S/O or have other groups sitting right next to you. The walls are heavily decorated with a lot of interesting pieces to examine while you wait for your food as well.Food: we got the Filipino Tosilog and Chengdu chicken and waffles. The tosilog was good but not mind-blowing if you\\'re used to Asian cuisine, but it\\'s definitely still an enjoyable and filling meal. The chicken & waffles dish was splendid! I\\'m usually skeptical of white establishments doing fish sauce wings (secondary to Portland\\'s Pok Pok), and not usually a fan of chicken and waffles, but I was very pleasantly surprised by how flavorful this dish was. The wings were crispy, juicy, not too salty, & the use of chili pepper, basil, mint, & lime juice makes every bite a delight. It was probably the best fish sauce wings I\\'ve had in a long time. The waffles were great and went really well with the chicken. I didn\\'t use the maple syrup, since I personally hate the \"chicken and syrup\" combo, so no comment on that. Service was cordial, prices were fair, & would definitely come back and bring friends along!', \"Good food. Really loved the decor. Vegetarian options are limited. Burmese salad was extremely good. Dessert was interesting, but I didn't love it.\", \"Amazing food here. Personally LOVE the Chengdu Spicy Jumbo Chicken Wings, pineapple cornbread, Pakistani Peshawari Chapli Kabab, Burmese Laphet Toke, Balinese Barbecued Spare Ribs. I wasn't crazy about the bunny chow (I didn't like how it got cold in the bread), but the flavor was on point and my girlfriend had rave reviews for it. Gujarati Style Brussels Sprouts were unimpressive, my friends from Gujarati said they couldn't figure out why they were particularly Gujarati-style.\", 'We ended up at Nue by accident but we were glad that we did. We weren\\'t too familiar with the cuisine, so we ended up asking the waiter what his favourite dishes were (I love doing this).What we got:- pineapple cornbread 5/5- chengdu spicy jumbo chicken wings 4/5- South African bunny chow 4/50I\\'d come here again just to try the different dishes! They have Thai Water Beetles for the \"adventurous.\"', \"What an awesome spot in Cap Hill! Recommend 100%!! Fun atmosphere with eclectic decor and ironic imagery. Great menu with good explanations and creative expressions of modern Mediterranean cuisine. We ordered the Beirut Style Hummus and we were blown away. Actually authentic hummus with good toasted pita bread that was lightly flavored with salt and garlic. The hummus was topped with fried garlic which gave it nice flavor and crunch and wilted mint which added a perfectly fresh backseat flavor that rounded it out. For our meals we ordered the Pakistani Peshawari Chapli Kabab (Halal) and the South African Bunny Chow. The Kabab dish was my personal favorite dish I've had at any restaurant in a really long time. It was very well flavored and finished with slightly sweet and tangy from the sauces and the pickled onions on top. The meat was tender and perfectly seasoned! The Bunny Chow was also really flavorful and good! Not my first choice but if you like chicken Marsala you will LOVE this. For drinks we got the Smoldering Paloma which was very spicy (which I love) and well balanced! I ended up getting two of them and I would normally get something new for the second round but it was too good! We also got the Ruou Ran Cobra and the Beetle Juice. The Cobra was very strong but still well balanced and flavorful and the Beetle Juice was surprisingly fresh and easy to drink! Overall, amazing service, wonderful atmosphere and absolutely unbelievable food and drinks. Highly recommend.\", \"The Filipino pork was super flavorful. Sunny Bunny was a disappointment. Bread was too thick and there wasn't enough curry to dip with the bread. Friendly service and a nice local restaurant.\", \"Came in on a Friday right as it opened at 10:00am. Completely empty, just how I like to review restaurants. It gives me an appreciation for the restaurant's ambiance and the decorum of servers when uninitiated. The food can be described as an eclectic sampling of tastes from 'round the world. We had dishes that hail from the territories/countries of Puerto Rico (U.S. Territory), South Africa (country), China (country), and Taiwan (country). Where else are you going to trail blaze continents and oceans in pursuit of one meal?Puerto Rican Mofongo - This was arguably my favorite, just because I did not know what to expect. The garlic plantain mash was a delightful carb, and when mixed with the eggs and the latin american spices, made for a unique mouthful of mushy/gooey goodness. I would definitely order this to try. 5/5South African Sunny Bunny - This one gets all the pictures (along with the next one below) and is a decent choice. It is popular among the patrons of Nue (according to the owner) and it certainly is good. But, what I read on paper and what I ate, was exactly the same. No surprises, which in a way is good, but in some regard it's a little disappointing. I was thinking it would taste like bread dipped in curry, and that's exactly what it was like. Worth a try, but imo more novelty for pictures than for taste. 4/5Chengdu Tower of Chicken - Okay, this is the picturesque photo of food at Nue. Everybody loves seeing towers upon towers, stacked high to the sky like the Babylons did it, of chicken piece after chicken (except for the vegetarians, no apologies this time). A nice blend of spices with the fish sauce and sichuan peppercorns really bursting through to your taste buds. If you like wings and can handle spice, take a winner in the Chengu chicken. 5/5We ended with a couple desserts:Taiwanese Peanut Ice Cream Wrap/Burrito - It's a slight variation on what you might find in Taiwan in the Night Markets, but it's a good attempt at it and worth a try. I thought it was a tad too sweet overall and actually preferred the other dessert (below). Unfortunately just because I'm Taiwanese does not mean I give preference to Taiwanese food. 3/5Guava Ice Cream - Wow. Such a great combination of sweet and sour, tangy and milky. This consisted of a base of guava ice cream and a caramelized slice of orange sliced in the middle. Additional toppings of mint, fennel seeds, and one other floral ingredient (the pink/purple bits in the photos) that created a confluence of flavors. This completed our meal, a must try. 5/5TL;DR: It's hard to go wrong at Nue, just pick your favorite countries (don't be racist), or just go with the winners of Chengu Chicken (if you like protein), and the Puerto Rican Mofongo. But really, I'm sure many of the other dishes are delightful as well.\", \"We went on a hot summer day in Seattle to Nue, and I still can't decide what was worse, if the food or the hot day. First of all, it was a highly recommended place, but the food didn't match the recommendations (or expectations). We had Chengdu Spicy Jumbo Chicken Wings and the South African Bunny Chow (is chicken, not bunny). The chicken wings were ok, but it felt like they were generic chicken wings, something you could get cheaper at other places. Frankly, Buffalo Wild wings are as good as the wings we had. The African Bunny Chow was pretty tasty and something I had never tried before. I didn't know what was this dish before I came to Nue, but it is a chicken curry with bread. I have to say it was good. The bread absorbs all the curry and mixed with the chicken is an amazing combination. I have given this place three stars because the bunny dish was pretty good, and something new, but I wouldn't come back. I didn't feel the prices matched the whole experience. To me, a great place (no matter the price point) takes care of every single detail. I don't know if it was the heatwave or just how it usually is, but the place and service felt neglected. I felt the place was dirty and the food was made in a rush.\", 'Food and service was good. The pineapple coconut cornbread was a bit of a let down (drrrryyyyy) but the shashuska, fried chicken wings (juicy!), and waffles were very nice.', 'We made a reservation for 12:00, they seated us at 12:35. I am OK with not having a reservation system, but not OK with being deceived. The food was pretty good for seattle. Some interesting ideas and overall decently executed.', \"Bf and I came here on a Monday around lunch time. We weren't really craving anything at the time so we were decided to try out a new restaurant/dishes. Nue is an interesting take on the theme travel in the food industry. Unlike some restaurants that has a core focus on a type of food from around the world, Nue draws upon taking spices and dishes from all corners of the globe and introducing it in an innovative and quirky way: either in presentation or combining seemingly unrelated flavors. We ordered the Pineapple Cornbread, Syrian Kale and Carrot Salad and Chengdu Chicken Wong Tower. Everything we ordered was delicious and did not disappoint. The pineapple cornbread was lightly glazed with pineapple that was a nice flavor but not over saturating the dish with pineapple flavor. There was a subtle zest in every bite especially at the ends of the cake. The cream and the syrup were nice with the dish when the cornbread got too monotonous. I was in love with the toasted coconut flakes! The Syrian Kale and Carrot Salad was very delicious! I should have asked what topping they had that added the middle eastern zest. The kale was soft and the dressing was refreshing.I was most excited about the wings. Basil and sweet sauce adored the base of the tower as six wings were arranged vertically on skewers. The wings were in a wet sauce so it didn't have quite the crunch factor that I usually like in my wings but I loved the flavor! Crushed peppercorn pack a punch so be warned. I was feeling a numbing sensation after just two wings.Overall, Nue creates an opportunity for those who haven't sampled their way around the world a chance to do so. A little pricey I'd have to admit but I would still come back!\", \"Booked a reservation with Nue to celebrate my birthday. Our group was 16 and they were able to flawlessly accommodate us. The pros: Great, diverse set of foods from various parts of the world. Everything was bursting with flavor. My favorite by far has to be the Chapli kabobs. Adding the little mix they include (Indian snack mix) really adds a great complementing flavor to the dish. The portion sizes justifies the prices that you see on the menu. The bunny chow was an awesome dish with great flavor and the chicken was cooked well. A few at our table for the Malaysian vegetarian dish and they really enjoyed it. The 'Trinidadian Doubles' are very similar to an Indian dish called Poori & Channa Masala.Drinks were pretty good, however we did have to send one back because it tasted like they skimped on the alcohol just a tad. Cons: For celebrating ones birthday, you'd think the restaurant would have made at least a small gesture to acknowledge the event as to why everyone was celebrating and why such a big group was out to eat. I had emailed the owners to request the reservation so I am surprised even they did not have any appreciation or thoughts of celebration that we chose their venue to host and spend $600+ on a Thursday night for a meal. The lack of customer service on that front reduces my desire to return. Nothing wrong with the cuisine. The food is awesome, period.\", \"The food at Nue is unlike anything else. \\xa0Varied and unique menu, cozy atmosphere, communal seating, and really delicious food. \\xa0We have been in one time for brunch now, have had their food at an off-site venue, and would love to come in for dinner. \\xa0We had great service during our visit and the food was filling and exciting. \\xa0Prices aren't cheap but again the portions are fairly hefty. \\xa0I definitely want to come back for dinner or happy hour and try their cocktails and the rest of the interesting sounding food menu.\", \"We went here based on a recommendation from a fellow Yelper. Excellent recommendation. The space is fun. Decorated with assorted, global, and eccentric bric-a-brac that includes some food items. (I hope they have a system for keeping all the knickknacks dusted as time goes on.) The seating is all family style on long tables or tall long tables with bar seats. If you want a private space, this is not the place for you. If you want to relax and have fun, come on in.The food is exceptional. It's creative and superbly executed. It includes influences from around the globe, sometimes as is and sometimes in an exciting fusion tango of flavor on your tongue.Don't miss the Chengdu Chicken. On this trip, I had it in the Chengdu Chicken and Waffles. This is a US southern meets Thai meets Szechuan fusion that is amazing. I could eat this every day. The chicken is also available as its own dish with more chicken. I would add that these are the biggest, meatiest, and juiciest chicken wings I have ever tasted. We also had the Dutch War Fries on this trip, and they were very tasty.Service is also exceptional. It's friendly, professional, and attentive. And the servers will happily help you navigate the eclectic menu and/or chat about the unique origins of each dish.We will be back. Again and again. We must eat our way through this entire menu. I want to go back now just from writing this.Just go here. Period. You will be happy......What are you waiting for?.....Why are you still here? Go to Nue now! Your mouth will sing your praises for days for doing so.\", \"As good as it gets. Eclectic and touristy fast food place. Totally unassuming and quaint. We came here for brunch on a Sunday morning and it was pretty packed. We ordered chicken and waffles, some pork dish, war chips, corn bread. All of them are very flavorful and tasty. Skip the fine dining and check this out for a change, you won't be disappointed. My only complaint is that the service is a tad bit slow. Do check it out!\", \"As good as it gets.

I'll definitely have to go back to try a couple of the signature dishes and grab an evening cocktail.\", 'The bunny chow was delicious! Able to easily reserve a table and felt comfortable dining outside warmed by heaters placed by each table.', \"Wow! Hands down one of the favorite restaurant my husband and I visited this year. This place has been bookmarked for so long, I don't know what took me this long. We visited on a friday night around 4:45, and we lucked out with our seats. As the night went on, the store was quickly filled. We ordered the tower wings, Japanese katsu sandwich, and fries. All our foods came out pretty quickly and everything was amazing. All the flavors were definitely not expected. The wings were probably the best I have ever had! Sweet, spicy, and savory all at the same time was unbelievable. It had a very unique sweet fish sauce and it was nothing that I have ever had. The fries had some sort of peanut mayo sauce(?) which was surprisingly one of the best combinations. If you couldnt tell already, I loved Nue, and I will definitely will be coming back for more! The only downside for me is the seating here. This is not a typical restaurant with small two people seatings available. There are only big tables which will make you sit with strangers. But food so good, its worth it.\", 'Service was mediocre and I felt as if no one cared whether we were helped or not. All tips are pooled and it felt like they were all doing the least amount of customer service unless you flagged someone down, even then, some gave a little attitude. Huge turn off. The food was decent to good. We ordered the pineapple cornbread (actually really good) and the chengdu spicy chicken wings (ok/good). The place is super eclectic and a fun atmosphere, I would be very skeptical about recommending to a friend, but overall it was a 5.5/10.', \"Really loved tbe cornbread and toasted coconut. Wasn't a fan of the Chengdu Wings, it tasted like a cross between honey wings and unseasoned meat. The sweet sauce was too sweet and rich maling the bland wings difficult to enjoy. The Filipino dish was decent. 4 stars for the cornbread.\", \"Literally a melting pot of deliciousness from the brunch to the drinks everything taste full flavored fresh and made with love. It's packed and always full for good reason.\", \"Worth the hype and the wait get the chicken and waffles if you're into spice savory and sweet crispy and carbs\", 'After going to Capitol Hill Cider and being told they were minutes away from \"drinks only\" time, we wandered over to this gem. I\\'m so glad we did! I\\'m giving 4, instead of 5 stars, due to an allergen scare that was resolved. Ambiance: This place is quirky, which I\\'ve come to appreciate about hidden gems in Seattle. It\\'s intimate so I imagine it\\'s a tight squeeze when they\\'re busy. We walked in Sat afternoon with plenty of space and no wait. Their menu seems inspired from all over the world, which is so much fun for me as a globe trotter. Food and drinks: The flavors are out of this world! To drink, we ordered Vietnamese coffee (strong and sweet!) and the jägertea (an improvement on a hot toddy). For food, \\xa0our table ordered pineapple cornbread, fried chicken, kabob, and brussel sprouts. Portions were generous and good food sharing. We cleaned our plates and enjoyed every bite! Service: Good but room for improvement. I requested the kabob gluten free, and while they made some modifications, 1) the kitchen wasn\\'t notified and 2) a crunchy topping arrived on my plate that was questionably not gluten-free. When I asked our server, he said he thought it wasn\\'t gluten free and offered to remake the dish. As I was rushing for a flight, I scraped off the topping instead. When the server brought out the check, I asked to speak to the manager because I don\\'t play around with food sensitivities! She committed to following up with the staff to ensure they are sensitive to allergens and surprised us with a 10% discount for the scare. In short, despite the allergen issue, I would go back. I will also really push to make sure any dish that I order is allergen friendly.', \"Nue is now one of my local favorites for international cuisine. Everything I've tried here is just delicious. My favorite is the acaraje, taste just like the akara from West Africa plus some seafood. The ribs, wings, and curries are also really good! The plates are mostly shareable style with the exception of the curries. The malva pudding didn't taste as great as some I've had at other places but was still pretty good.The style of the restaurant is also very eclectic. Space isn't very big inside so its better for small or medium size groups. Also be sure to make a reservation as its very popular!\", 'Came here with a girlfriend and ordered the South African bunny chow and chengdu wings per our server\\'s suggestions. There are pics of these two items all over their Yelp too so we figured it was a safe bet. The South African bunny chow was pretty big and flavorful. It\\'s kinda like a curry in a bread bowl. I preferred this to the wings. The chengdu wings are def Instagram worthy but the flavors were underwhelming. The reviews hyped it up so much but I felt like it didn\\'t have that \"oomph\" factor I was waiting for. The restaurant is small and communal seating. We were packed so closely together. I don\\'t care too much for communal seating cause I feel like there\\'s no privacy and you constantly hear the other people\\'s conversations. It\\'s definitely a unique vibe but it just wasn\\'t the vibe for my friend and I.', \"Went here for brunch and it was so delicious. I'm a sucker for chicken and waffles and I loved the spicy tangy sweet twist they had to theirs. Yum.\", \"Fantastic dining experience. It's my first time in Seattle and my heart already found a place to hold on to - Nue. My partner and I ordered 3 items plus drinks. I was only able to take a pic of 1 of the food items we ordered cause I was so hungry lol.We ordered the pineapple cornbread to start, and oh my, it took my tastebuds straight back home to Asia. The cornbread itself is baked with pineapple bits and juice, toasted in butter, and topped with desiccated coconut. You will love it because the pineapple makes the bread less dense and more moist. The coconut added a variety of texture and flavor. It just reminded me of home, tbh.Then we had the Chengdou Spicy Jumbo Chicken Wings (pictured). I am a sucker for salt/pepper/vinegar fried chicken and this one surely hit the spot. The chicken wings were double dipped in batter, showered with a vinegar/lime/s+p glaze, and topped with Thai basil and chili. It was freaking amazing, I basically cleaned the meat off the bones. Last thing we got was the Malaysian Kari - it was a red curry with potatoes, bell peppers and basil, served with 2 fresh roti breads. It was also an amazing dish and I loved the roti. The texture was not super chewy which is my personal preference. It's got a flaky exterior which can make a mess but honestly just wipe it off afterwards, the roti is worth the mess. The curry itself was great, although I can't say much about it. I eat too much curry that it wasn't a recipe that floored me. As for drinks, we got a beer (nothing exciting) and a Limau Assam Boi. That second drink, my friends, was another nostalgic ride of flavors. Calamansi, lemon/lime, wild honey and preserved plum. All tropical asian flavors in a glass. Overall, this place is heavenly and I will definitely come back every time I'm in town.\", 'We decided to try a new place for brunch and it is genuinely one of the most \"Seattle\" places I\\'ve ever been. I was a little surprised by the wide range of cultural dishes but we tried the things we confuse the most. Both of us were happily surprised with our tasty food! It was a pretty slow time, I think we were too early for the lunch rush so we had a lot of help from the staff and everyone was very kind to us. I loooove peanut sauce in all forms and putting them on fries and pairing with crispy Brussels \\xa0is GENIUS. I had the bunny chow which was way more food than I needed but super fun to try! We ended our meal with the pineapple coconut cornbread and hollyyyyyyyy stars it was such a treat. I think we\\'re going to go back just to buy a pan of that stuff!The only reason I\\'m giving it 4 stars is that it\\'s not quite a traditional brunch place, which is how it\\'s advertised. Not much breakfast food on the menu.', 'Brunch review:Brunch here is awesome! Their food selection honors the lesser known food entree of the Asian world: tosilog, shakshuka, etc! The number one pro is the atmosphere. Very intriguing with a wall completely cluttered with knickknacks and eclectic dolls. Every time I come I play I-spy with my friends.Food always tastes good, but sometimes the plating is not my favorite. The shakshuka is amazing, the chengdu chicken and waffles are perfect numbing spice, and the desayuno mechiacana or something is also really tasty.', \"Where do you go when it's 1:30 pm and you haven't eaten yet? Brunch at Nue! This chicken and waffle dish with an Asian twist is serious business... It disappeared way too fast. It's got a nice spicy kick to it that's complemented very nicely with the seasoning on the chicken and the sweetness of the syrup. The Filipino fried rice dish was something I'll never say no to.

We went with a group of 6 and all ordered something different so we could try many things and nothing disappointed. Our waitress was very nice- it was her first night but you wouldn\\'t have known it. \\xa0I gave it 4 stars because of our \"wait\" experience. We had put in our name online and were given a time frame of 45- an hour. When we arrived after being notified, we ended up waiting another hour because the group whose table we were taking were still chatting. They had settled up, didn\\'t order any drinks or more food, but just sat and chatted.

I got the bug juice as a drink, which is the water beetle infused vodka martini. It's a strong drink, tastes mostly like vodka infused with something fruity, but it was fun. We also got the fries with garlic mayo and peanut sauce, and hummus and pita. The fries weren't anything special and I liked the garlic mayo, but the peanut sauce wasn't my favorite as a combo. The pita was only okay, but I really liked the hummus, it was smooth and rich.\", \"Came here with a friend as soon as we landed from Minneapolis. The picture we saw of their chicken wings had us sold!We came at an odd time, around 2ish so after lunch rush and before dinner, but did not mind basically having the whole place to ourselves!Nue boasts they have a diverse menu from many different countries and I can attest they do! \\xa0The decor reflects their diverse menu, which is eclectic with items from all the countries on their menu.We started out with the Taiwanese Chicken heart poppers. They had great flavor and came with a sweeter dipping sauce that tasted great with them.We also shared the Chengdu Jumbo Fried chicken wings. Made with peppercorns, lime, chili, fish sauce, mint and Thai chili pepper, this provided a lot of punch to the dish. The presentation of the wings would make you want to order it to see what it's all about. Arranged like a tower on skewers, it looked too pretty to eat, but one always gives in when it's food. \\xa0You can dip the wing in the pepper lime mixture at the bottom for more flavor (this is also a traditional dipping sauce in Vietnamese cuisine too).We also got the Malaysian Curry Laksa, which was a seafood curry with egg noodle, coconut cream (caramelized), prawns, fish balls, egg, sambal, red pepper, and rau ram - mint). Mmm this broth was so creamy and the seafood tasted even better with it. The egg noodles added a great texture and was cooked really well\", 'Choosing this restaurant on a Saturday evening w/the limited outdoor seating in Capital Hill brought out party of 4 a suprise! Tent seating w/2 propane filled heaters to our table. We had the jumbo wings, which were decorated with much flavor. The Balinese Sate Lilet was like eating in the middle of Thailand and the best meal well put together for us, was the Korean Budae Jjigae! With the menu full of plates from different areas of the world, these chefs take trips and bring back their favorite dishes. A must try!', \"It's so trendy. The walls are lit up with lights and artfully arranged with bottles, trinkets, and various decorations you might find at an Asian gift shop. Yes, it's very hipster (you know, because Capitol Hill). The inside space is small, but not cramped as one might imagine. Visually, this place comes together quite well. *hold for applause* Now onto the food. They have an ambitious menu covering several different street foods from different countries. For appetizers, the East Indies brussels sprouts are just so-so. They come out fried to a crisp, and are topped with coconut shavings, but still, there's no wow factor about them. The Brazilian Acarajé are really good though! It's a fritter that's fried with a light outside and a savory middle. Has a pleasant nutty and citrusy flavor to it. The Chengdu spicy jumbo chicken wings are okay. It has a mild peppery flavor; not a very crispy texture, but juicy with the taste of fish oil. I was expecting more of a spicy kick though. Chengdu is the capital city of Sichuan province in China, which is notable for its spicy peppercorn, so where was the spiciness? My main entree was the Malaysian curry laksa. It was on the boring side of food spectrum, and not very Malaysian. It comes as a heap of egg noodles in a bowl of seafood coconut curry with two prawns and like three fish balls. Look, I get that it's Asian Fusion, but this is just some watered down noodle bowl with skimpy portions all around. One more thing- when the bowl came, the chopsticks were pointed inside the bowl. That's an Asian cultural no-no. But hey, so trendy! This place has exceptionally high ratings on Yelp, but I can assure you that I take no pleasure saying it's overrated. The egg in the laksa was cooked perfectly and the service was great, so I'll give them an extra star to my review for that.\", \"I've been here plenty of times and its usually great and a real treat for out-of-towners. However, this recent dinner was so awful, it needs to be told. It wasn't even the food, it was the bartender. We were eating, and the bartender comes over and states it's last call (15 minutes after they seated us, which is weird and a bit BS, considering the restaurant was open for another 45 minutes). He actually said that last call was in 5 minutes, so we said, cool, we'll order then. Then our waitress came up 3 minutes later, so we ordered a round of drinks. not 2 minutes later, the bartender comes over and just starts yelling at us ands say it it not ok to take advantage of his staff. We explained the situation and he called us liars. Actually used the word that we're underhanded and liars. We were really looking forward to this meal, and instead he ruined our night and made us want to cry. I will not be taking guests to this restaurant again. I'm embarrassed on behalf of my city to my visitors. The only reason this is not 1 star is the food was pretty good, although not as good as usual, so maybe the bartender yelled at the cooks, too, and they were unhappy.\", \"There are many fusion type restaurants in Cap Hill that hipsters and instagrammers flock to. Most of them look better than they taste. Thankfully, Nue is one of the few exceptions.SPACELocation is convenient but parking can be tricky.

Looking for a way to celebrate my parents\\' 30 years of adventurous, travel-filled marriage, I stumbled upon Nue and thought there couldn\\'t be a better homage to their love of new cultural experiences--during a time when they can\\'t travel--than a restaurant that specializes in global street fare. I reached out over email to figure out what a special meal might look like during COVID conditions. Chris, the owner, spent time over the course of weeks helping me determine a menu that would carry out well or could be finished up at my parents\\' home on the Eastside. Under his recommendations, I ordered (for 6 people - there is definitely a little of everything left over but I wanted a lot of variety):- South African Bunny Chow - Kashmiri Avocado Hummus- Indonesian Ribs- Jamaican Jerk Chicken- Trinidadian Channa Curry- Malaysian Kari Kentang- Pineapple Cornbread- Syrian Kale Salad- Thai Water Beetles (how can you not??)My order was ready promptly at our agreed time of 6pm, and the restaurant handily has a loading zone right out front so it\\'s easy to pick up. Chris was kind enough to come in personally so he could tell me how to reheat the food properly and how to eat the beetles. He even tucked in a bottle of champagne with his compliments to my parents for their anniversary. (Chris, my parents loved it - and my dad isn\\'t a champagne guy!)The food was varied and delightful - my personal favorites were the Malaysian kari and roti, the ribs (the slaw is excellent), and the jerk chicken, which was delightfully tender even after reheating. The beetles were definitely an adventurous experience that I recommend - it helps to treat it as if you\\'re eating a crab. My family loved the global theme and the delicious food. I can\\'t wait until Nue is able to reopen fully!In summary: The food is great and feels true to each country of origin. Eating at Nue is such a fun way to \"travel\" during the age of coronavirus. And you can\\'t beat the attentive, creative, comprehensive service I experienced. These are people who love what they do and put their all into it. I highly recommend this place!', \"I had seen photos of Nue's food on social media and was eager to give them a try when visiting Portland. I arrived on the early side for dinner and was able to take advantage of the happy hour menu (served from 3-6pm). I started with the East Indies brussel sprouts and absolutely loved them. I then had a dish that looked like an Asian version of fried crab cakes/tacos - sounds odd, but it was very good. I found it too heavy for one person, especially since this one person had just had an appetizer.A large group came in while I was there and ordered a bunch of things off the menu to share. That definitely seems like the best way to enjoy all the unusual dishes on their menu!\", \"I'm so glad this place is still able to operate during this time! Great customer service and everything tasted really good!\", \"I'm a fan of Nue. This place takes you on a journey, and I am talking about food, decor, AND music!

Their happy hour menu is great and everyone in our group loved the cocktails. My personal favorite is \\u200btheir pineapple-coconut-cornbread\\u200b. SO delicious. And you can get a whole pan of it! I might have to order one sometime... It's a small space and seating is family style, this way you might end up with more friends than the ones you brought in with you, which is nice in my opinion.

The dish is topped with a Farm Fresh Egg and Served in a Pullman Bread Bowl.PROS:- fantastic quantity, definitely shareable between parties, just have to cut the chicken up accordingly- great flavors and not overly heavy on the spices, especially with the masala.CONS:- because of the sauce, the bread tends to have some soggy parts if you don't eat this right away. \\xa0It's not bad if you're going to use the bread to sop up the gravy but I am not a fan of soggy bread in general.UN Fried Rice: This is now the Filippino Tosilog...the only thing that may have changed is the meat section. PROS:- good quantity, definitely shareable as well- nice flavors in the fried riceCONS:- not anything distinctive, a very safe but still enjoyable dish.I'd definitely come back for dinner. \\xa0If their brunch menu is this good, I can only imagine that their dinner options are also great. \\xa0The decor is very interesting and unique, some would call it clutter, but I've definitely seen worse in my friends' houses. Definitely give it a try!\", \"I don't think I would go back but I did enjoy the experience. We also got the coffee cocktail which was good but not amazing. Perhaps some of the other items are more exciting.\", \"Ok the taste was pretty good but the food seemed to be not that fresh. Considering the allure of the restaurant I believe these things matter a lot. The food seems to be a bit uncooked and that made me notice the staleness of the food upon observation. I'll give it a 3/5.\", \"We had a surprise party planned here for a party of 12 this weekend. The food overall was great, but the service was not. Our waiter was impatient and continued to get orders wrong, and then seemed irritated that he had to fix mistakes. Overall we spent $1000 at this establishment and we're RUSHED out because apparently they have a 90min time limit for you to order, eat and leave. He continued to remind our guests of this before we even received our food, like we were on a count down. There was also miscommunication because our waiter never addressed the table as a whole. So one half of the table was ordering food under the impression we were all sharing family style, while the other half of the table ordered their own individual meals. So come time for the check, some want to split the whole bill while others only want to pay for what they ate. Which would have been fine if the waitstaff had properly delivered items ordered to who ordered them. The side of the table that was closest to the kitchen is where all the food was being dropped so some people had items eaten and never received them. All in all I would not come back here solely based on our service experience. The food was excellent.\", \"Came to this restaurant because it was in the heart of Cap hill and all the other restaurants nearby were full. I'm not much of a chicken and waffles person but nothing else in the menu seemed that intriguing so I decided why not try their signature brunch menu. The food came out in huge portions so that was nice. The taste, however, I didn't find that great. The chicken was Ok but I thought it was too sweet because the menu described the item as more of a savoury option. The waffles were SOFT and not crispy at all which was also quite disappointing in my opinion. Because the waffles were soft and mushy, I ended up eating it separately with the chicken (then what's the point of the dish?) Their service, however, was pretty good and everyone was really nice so I give Nue a point for that. Not sure if I'd return as I've had better chicken and waffles elsewhere!\", \"I've been meaning to visit Nue for a while since moving here and was glad we could finally make it here for dinner last night. We had the bunny chow and chengdu wings, which were right on point with spice. The Sichuan peppercorns in the wings had that numbing quality which was a welcome addition. For drinks we had the Atlas Shrubbed and Naranjarita both of which were delicious. The Naranjarita was my favorite, it had the right balance with Tamarind and Orange juice. The weakest link was the fries. They were strictly okay and came with garlic mayonnaise and peanut satay sauce -- I cannot say peanut sauce is a good accompaniment for frites but maybe that's a personal preference. All in all, a great place to dine in\", \"Fusion tapas from all around the world?! Love the concept of this place! The interior is decorated very aptly, with Chinese lanterns hanging along the bar, and a wall of offbeat, cosmopolitan trinkets. Came here with a friend last Sunday who was visiting Seattle and we really enjoyed our time here. Made reservations a day in advance on OpenTable and we had no issues getting a seat -- the restaurant was actually pretty empty around 5:30 PM. As per Yelp's recommendation, we ordered the South African bunny chow, Chengdu spicy jumbo chicken wings, and the pineapple coconut cornbread. Let me just start off by saying the cornbread was TO DIE FOR -- the perfect amount of buttery sweetness elevated to another level by the toasted coconut flakes on top (currently drooling as I think about how awesome it was). We ended up ordering seconds because we could not get enough of this stuff! (5/5)The South African bunny chow reminded me a lot of a honey toast box with a savory twist since it was served in the same type of box-shaped toast. The interior was filled with chicken tikka masala and stewed veggies that really soaked into the bread. My first bite of this was amazing, but I feel like (maybe we were eating too slowly?) once the bread became soggier and the food got colder I wasn't as interested in this dish. (3.5/5)The Chengdu chicken wings were served up pipping hot and plated very aesthetically! They put just the right amount of Szechuan spice in the breading, but I wish the breading was just a tad thinner. All in all, very juicy and flavorful wings though! (4/5)I defs want to come back here with a bigger group to sample more of the unique dishes they have to offer!\", \"A truly unique dining destination where each diner can order an authentic dish from a different country. One only gone for brunch so far, but it's gotten me excited to go back for more!Chengdu wings: awesome wings. Well flavored, tender, and with just the right amount of kick.Roti canai: I have missed Malaysian food so much and it doesn't get any better than this. Roti was perfectly executed; buttery and crispy. The curry was on point.\", 'They have a 90 minute limit on how long you can stay there after which point you are kicked out. While we were forewarned when we sat down, I wish they had told me about this when I made reservations as opposed to when we sat down. We were basically kicked out while still having our drinks after the meal. The food was good and the concept itself is nice, but I will not visit again while this rule is in place. I have never been to a restaurant that kicks out patrons with a time limit, and there are plenty of wonderful choices in Cap Hill where you can enjoy your meal and have an unrushed experience.', 'We decided to come here for brunch! Different, yet so delicious! What we ordered: Israeli Shakshuka - skillet eggs cooked in rich tomato, red pepper and feta ragout served with pita. A bit spicy, but delicious! Filipino Tosilog - housemade cures pork, sinangag garlic and scallion fried rice, spy & chili vinegar, atchara, and two eggs sunny side up. Must try! Pineapple and coconut cornbread with whipped butter and maple syrup. You must get the cornbread! Absolutely incredible!', 'Super unique and tasteful place. Worth a try. We ordered two dishes. The tower of chengdu has nothing to do with chengdu flavor expect the hot red pepper. It is more like Vietnamese fried chicken wings with extra flavor of spices. It has a bite of sweetness in it too. I am a chicken lover, this fix me well. From the picture, sunny bunny looks heavy. \\xa0We did not order it in the beginning until we saw it from the table next to us. The portion is just right for me. It is also hard to imaging toast + curry combinations. But it comes out well matched. The curry is very delicious. I love the presentation of this dishes that gives you imagination of the taste. Overall, it is a great and thoughtful place. The only issue we had is the service is too slow.', \"Wow it was my first time getting food from here and I was impressed - it was also a takeout order (during covid restrictions) for my friends' birthday and they live walking distance from Nue. It was really refreshing seeing different items on the menu that you don't normally find at a lot of restaurants. They had a spread for exploration. I ordered the tower of chengdu wings which had some large yummy spices on it - delicious! We got an order of the chicken & waffles which were so flavorful and crispy! The Filipino Tosilog was literally my favorite dish as it reminded me of my trip to the Philippines. The South African Sunny Bunny was a very tasty curry like dish which caught us by surprise. We can't wait to go dine in to get an ever better experience with the food!\", 'The brussel sprouts side is small. Should be more generous with the Brussels. The food is downright delicious and unique.', \"We had a reservation but they had us wait outside for a good bit while they prepared our table. Our party of 3 ended up getting stuffed at the end of a long table with my utensils constantly falling off the table and I was constantly bumping elbows with the party seated next to me. The food took forever to come out of the kitchen which is not a surprise considering how packed the restaurant was. Can't blame the joint for being popular. Once the food arrived I was excited to dig in. The portions were all very tiny. I suggest 1.5 dishes per person. We ordered the bunny chow which was stuffed in a hollowed out loaf of bread. Yum. The wing tower was more of a wing hut. There were only 6 wings. Hardly a meal. The Puerto Rican mofongo is fun to say and it is also fun to eat. I think this is the first Puerto Rican dish I have ever eaten. Everything here was quite tasty. 3.5 stars rounded down to 3.\", \"Yooooo. This place packs in the flav. Lots of people go here just to say the went or get a pic of the food for status, \\xa0but if you legit love food and just want some bomb freak'n wings, this place is worth the wait. Make sure to check in online. If you one of those non-planning types who thinks they can just walk up to a crowded restaurant and get in line, you wrong. Great food takes time, and this place makes great food.\", 'Excellent food. Every dish was unique and tasty. The wings were spicy and hot. Sunny bunny was flavorful and spicy but not hot. My favorite was the lentil curry - subtle fresh taste. Loved the vibe too. Paid parking just across the street.', \"Great atmosphere, tasty food full of flavor and spice! Can't wait to return with friends.\", 'Highly recommend the South African Bunny Chow! So flavorful with big chunks of chicken. I also had it over rice instead of on toast. My husband ordered the chickpea curry, which was a little too spicy for my liking, but he loved it as it had lots of potatoes. Also, the kale salad was delicious with yummy bites of chutney/raisins adding sweet bites of flavor. Great service as well. Highly recommend this place!', 'Nue is a very interesting and wonderful restaurant in Capitol Hill. \\xa0The goal for their restaurant is to bring casual food from around the world to Seattle, and as someone who has traveled quite a bit they do very nice job.In that spirit, it is best if you come with an open mind. \\xa0They have a good wine list, but I started with a \"Nue\" Fashioned--their version of an Old Fashioned and then had the Kat Chai (with vodka, honey, and plum). \\xa0Both were really good--then they have several other clever drink names (like the Beetle Juice and the Violette Femmes).For appetizers, I started with the Pineapple Cornbread and Acarje (from Brazil). \\xa0The cornbread is good, if a little on the sweet side for an appetizer. \\xa0The Acarje was really delicious--it is a fritter stuffed with a fish and nut mix and has a really unusual (but tasty) flavor. \\xa0I am not sure if it is always on the menu, but worth trying.For the main course I had the Laksa (which is a Malaysian curry) and a side of brussel sprouts. \\xa0The brussel sprouts were good while the Laksa was excellent. \\xa0It is kind of hard to describe--again another unusual dish and flavors (like if you dropped into a restaurant in Asia and just pointed at dish that looked good). The noodles were good, the fish was really nice, then the cream/broth was outstanding. \\xa0Really a brilliant dish.I also tried the goat curry. \\xa0I do not think I ever had goat before--but this was delicious as well.Unfortunately I did not have room for dessert. \\xa0Nue is definitely worth a visit.', \"Hmm. Not sure how I feel about Nue. \\xa0Yes, I would say our service was good. \\xa0The place was super crowded, we came in on a Friday night with a reservation. \\xa0With the whole european dinning set up, some people are not super friendly to sit near:(I don't recommend the corn bread or the wings. \\xa0Wings (called Hungarian Paprikas Jumbo Wings) were over powered by paprika and very fatty with little meat. \\xa0Not sure what people were smoking before they came in that spoke so highly of the cornbread it was very dry and flavorless - honey butter or something to add moisture would have been nice. \\xa0The curry (bunny chow) over rice was good. Also ordered the Fried Brussels sprouts and they were just Ok...the coconut seemed like it was an after thought?Wine/beer selection and prices were on the high side for portion served. Will try it again some day and order different items.\", \"What a fun eclectic concept in Seattle. Decorations were dorned with little knick knacks from around the world - be it a luche libre mask from Mexico, a street sign from China, or even wine bottles from Vietnam. Heck, even the bill/check comes out embedded between pages of travel books.Israeli shakshuka: cumin was abunandant but worked will with the tomato sauce and dry (middle Eastern?) cheese. 2 sunny side up eggs floated atop with pita bread accompanied the plate.Chengdu chicken wing tower: crispy and delicious can't go wrong w fried chicken! My only complaint would be to add more sauce on the side as a dip.Side of Filipino meat $9 (forgot the name) was sweet and charred. Similar to Vietnamese thit nuong!War fries: slathered in peanut sauce, Sriracha, and... Japanese mayo maybe? Skip this. Mehh. Fries weren't crunchy and flavors were odd and didn't mesh well together.\", \"This is the most surprising find in Seattle. The menu, at a glance, seems adventurous but if you're accustomed to high-impact flavors from different countries, this food feels right at home and special all the same. The drinks are fun and punchy and worth the price. The customer service is also always kind and timely.\", 'If zero stars was a choice, I would\\'ve rather done that than give them one star. My visit to Nue was \\'t only extremely disappointing, but sickening--literally. We ordered chicken and soon realized that it wasn\\'t cooked all the way through. We told our server (we don\\'t know their preferred pronouns, but they had blue hair) hoping that she could rectify the situation and possibly make our experience what we expected it to be great: it fell an extreme long way from that. She told us, \"that\\'s how it is,\" and went along with her day. My friends and I completely dumbfounded by her response, cuz Salmonella is a thing.She wasn\\'t rude, but lacked any evident training in customer service. We then asked to speak to a manager. She summons the owner. We tell the owner everything. She asked if we spoke to our server. We said yes. Next thing I know, we\\'re blatantly told, \"next time, you could talk to a server about this.\" If your server was of any help, I guess we wouldn\\'t have decided to be any sort of inconvenience to the owner. I\\'m sorry you can\\'t bother yourself to help us. Furthermore, she charged us for the drink which she offered, \"you guys can order another drink.\" Then, she checks us out and asks how was everything and that she took off the chicken and the initial drink okay.Verdict: I\\'m tired.', 'Great location on the side of the main area of Cap Hill. This small intimate space offers several cafeteria style tables as well as a long bar at the window looking out on the sidewalk. I sat by the window as I waited for my dinner companion and ordered items from the happy hour menu. I had the \"your nue bff\" dish paired with a drink (I chose white wine). The food portion of this order is a unique take on poutine/curry fries. I\\'m not sure sure how else to describe them because they are hard to explain except to say GET THEM!Next I had the homemade pineapple cornbread. This was fresh and wonderful. It was my first time having a flavored fruit cornbread and I am a huge fan!To round out the meal we shared the Brussels sprouts. Excellent choices all around for my palate. My friend ordered the Taiwanese chicken heart poppers and only realized what he was eating midway through the dish. Feeling grossed out and not enjoying that dish he left half of it behind when we left the restaurant. Note that this dish is not for the faint of heart. He also said it was bland and not very flavorful.', \"3.5 stars! i really like the idea of Nue since i am partial to street food. \\xa0Nue's premise is quite ambitious. \\xa0samples of street food from around the world? sounds awesome to me! stuff tried:chengdu fried chicken wings: loved this! it comes tacked like a leaning tower of crispy savory chicken wings! must try!grilled barbados pork tail: bony but deliciousgoat curry: i love goat, wish there more goaty goodness in this dishPuerto Rican Mafungo: garlic plantain mash is yummy!things change on the menu but there are some constants they do pretty well. \\xa0its impossible to knock every dish outta the park given the wide scope of the menu. \\xa0that being said its a fun place to try food from all over the globe without the plane ticket!\", \"We got here at around 9pm and were seated immediately. Service good and food was served relatively quickly.Ordered:- Chengdu Spicy Jumbo Chicken Wings (7.5/10): I thought it was clever of them to stack the wings so they didn't get soggy from the pool of sauce at the bottom. That said, these were not spicy whatsoever. In fact, they were sort of sweet lol especially at first taste. Still really tasty though, and the portion was enough for two people.- Pineapple Cornbread (8/10): I'm not really one to enjoy fruit-flavored uh anything but this was actually quite good. Bread was thic(c), pineapple flavor not strong enough to be unpalatable ahem, and the coconut flakes on top were a nice touch. Smaller than it looks though rip. Branching out!Nue was on my list of places to eat at while I was in Seattle and I'm pretty happy to say that it met my expectations. May have even exceeded them considering I definitely thought we'd have to wait for a bit before we got our table- yknow just from previous experience in the general sphere of Popular Restaurants in Seattle TM .. .. ha ha .ha. . Overall, would recommend!\", \"WOW! I honestly wasn't expecting to love this food - I've had a long history of avoiding fusion Asian restaurants, but this place really knocked it out of the park. We got the Chengdu chicken and waffles, and I loved the combination of savory and sweet in one place - the chicken was well spiced and extremely crisp, and the inherent sweetness of the waffles complemented the chicken well. Warning, the portions are BIG - just this dish alone was enough to feed me and my boyfriend :) Make sure to look out for this restaurant when planning your next brunch, or the next time you have a craving for both Asian/American style food.\", \"Got the worst diarrhea of my life after a $90 dinner on Saturday night of Labor Day weekend \\xa0I had the cornbread, chicken wings, ribs and bunny chow. My stomach hurt like hell for 2 hours after eating here and I sit on the toilet for an hour. It hurt so much that I couldn't even stand up. The next morning my stomach still rumbled, and made weird noises. I have eaten at so many restaurants all over the world and this is the first time in 27 years that I've got such a horrible stomachache. My boyfriend also had the same thing. I will never go here again!! 100% NOT recommend\", \"Mediocre food and bad service. The menu didn't have a good variety of options. I tried the chicken wings and fries. Fries were great, chicken wings were meh.\", \"Loved this place. We arrived \\xa0just in time for happy hour. Not only were the food and drinks good, but the staff was super friendly. We also enjoyed that this was not in a big tourist spot. (We were tourist)We tried a few dishes. The pineapple cornbread was sweet and moist. I left it till the end and was able to eat it as dessert. I love Brussels sprouts and theirs are tasty with a little twist to the normal Brussel sprout dish. The restaurant also offers unique dishes, so we decided to try the chicken hearts and the Thai mang da na (Thai water beetles). Yes, I said beetles. They smelled and tasted like licorice. We learned you don't eat the shell, just the inside. Probably won't eat those again. Drinks were good too. The mezcal shot with worm salt rim was worth the price tag. The bartender was nice enough to tweak my drink to my liking. Take a chance and enjoy their unique menu\", \"Every time I come here, I end up getting the chicken wings. It's such a large portion and tastes amazing! Definitely ask for their garlic dipping sauce on the side. Service was decent, and the drinks are great.\", '4.5 stars, but bumped up to 5 because I LOVE the concept of Nue! I get wayyy zealous when I see things that excite me, and Nue definitely excites me!!!! There are dishes from so many different countries and I believe they rotate seasonally! As someone who loves variety, this is like a dream come true! So bring all your adventurous eating partners here, because you will be in for a treat!! (Oh anddd they have tons of crazy wild options with bugs and animal parts you mostly see abroad)The one thing I sorta had an issue with that might work out in your favor here is actually the portion size - I was very confused by the portion size our server suggested for our party of 4 because it seemed on the heavier side....turns out we ordered a perfect amount (I think we were one appetizer short?). But the portion sizes were smaller than expected. DISHES: -Pineapple Cornbread (Pineapple, Coconut, Butter & Love) -- \\xa0I don\\'t love cornbread, but my friends loved this! (and I loved the butter)! This is the smallest item on the menu I believe, and it certainly is small for $4. It\\'s about the size of what you expect in a side biscuit.-Balinese Sate Lilit (Three Skewers of Prawn, Whitefish, Lime Leaf, Galangal and Spice \"Wrapped Around\" Lemongrass and Grilled) -- Didn\\'t love this...not for $13. Wouldn\\'t order again, but I don\\'t like my seafood to be mashed. -Puerto Rican Mofongo (Garlic Plantain Mash with Bacon, Pulled Smoked Chicken, Sofrito Sauce, and Blistered Peppers and Onions) -- this was the highlight dish for me!!! DELICIOUS is all I can say.-Chengdu Spicy Jumbo Chicken Wings (Green Szechuan Peppercorn, Fish Sauce, Lime, Chili, Basil, Mint, Thai Chili) -- This wasn\\'t my favorite but it wasn\\'t bad. There were mixed reviews among our group - some thought too much breading and others thought the breading was perfect. I just thought it was too sweet/fish sauce-y for Chengdu food. Still, it was enjoyable to eat.-Trinidadian Goat Curry (Slow Roasted Goat, Caribbean Spice, Ginger, Coconut & Pineapple Cornbread) -- this was my 2nd fav! Loved the texture of the rice on top of the salty curry. I\\'d recommend this to anyone who loves goat!', \"While planning my Seattle trip I must have looked at 200 different menus, but nothing stuck in my mind like the one at Nue! I mean they have such an awesome concept. They have a menu filled with dishes from all over the world and practically all of the items are an adventurous eaters dream come true.I wanted to order everything off including all of their cocktails because they're just so dang unique and that's everything I'm looking for in a restaurant especially if I'm away from home, but stuck with a few recommended items from my fellow Yelpers. FOOD:Chengdu Spicy Jumbo Chicken Wings (4.5 stars) - holy whoa my mouth was on fire! but I loved that tingly spice from the Szechuan peppercorn. I think I was the lucky one who got the real spicy wing bc my travel partner said they weren't that spicy. If you don't like fish sauce you won't like these but I love me some nguc mam. Huge portion, you could make this your whole meal. Barbadian Pig Tails (4 stars) - fried and covered with a jerk glaze. Super fatty little tails covered with meat. There was practically no bone, all cartilage which I love crunching on. Glaze could have used some spice it was a little too sweet for me. Very fatty, be prepared to have some shiny piggy lip gloss after you're done eating these. Pineapple Cornbread (5 stars) - I'd order this every single time it was soooo good! Moist and a little crunchy from the coconut. I wanted to order another one but I was so full and another piece would have been overkill even though they are not a huge portion. They have beetle juice martinis that are really infused with beetles! Also some kind of cobra scorpion infused liquor. Our bartender/server was happy to show us the cool bottles and let us take pictures of everything. I would be back in a heartbeat.\", 'Very good. Friendly staff. \\xa0Make a reservation because when we arrived at 5 it was empty only 2 couples seated along the window. \\xa0The greeter said they were fully booked but had 2 seats along the window. Really good food and hearty. \\xa0We I will be back but just plan ahead and get a table. Bunny chow is a must get!', \"Nue is my favorite restaurant in the US, hands down. Over the past 6 months, I've been doing a bit of a food tour around the US. Whenever I tell friends, they ask me which restaurant is my favorite. The answer is ALWAYS Nue. I was there in March 2019. This place is unreal. The Chengdu Spicy Chicken Wings are insane. The Bunny Chow is completely unique and amazing. I would die to have that again. The Brazilian Acaraje was something I've been dreaming about ever since. The restaurant itself is absolutely beautiful which elevates amazing food and drink to an amazing experience. I highly recommend Nue to everyone who lives in or visits Seattle. It's a must.\", \"Food: East Indies Brussel Sprouts // Chengdu Spicy Jumbo Chicken Wings // Presentation: They came out beautifully.Taste: Everything here is so unique and I wish I was more adventurous. They update their menus every so often, so the thing you get may not be there next time! Overall, the food is full of spices, flavor, and ton of texture in one dish. It tasted fresh and delicious.- Chengdu Spicy Jumbo Chicken Wings - Green Szechuan peppercorn, fish sauce, lime, chili, basil, mint and Thai chili. This was my favorite dish. I really recommend it. It came stacked on top of each other. I like eating spicy food, and did not find this spicy, but I know some people would find it mildly tingly. The chicken flavor was amazing.Service: Our server was friendly and nice. He didn't check in with us often as I am normally used to, but I'm not picky about that.Ambience and Decor: I came on a weekday during dinner time. We did not have to wait in line. It is a low lit place. It had a chill and casual vibe. There's not a lot of space though.\", 'Came for happy hour. Drink selection was good, and drink flavor was tasty but after 3 drinks and hardly any buzz we had to ask for a stronger drink, to which the server was receptive and helpful. Outdoor seating was pleasant and the chicken wings were so unique and flavorful. Please bring seafood back on the menu so there can be options for pescatarian oriented folks! The chicken burger was okay. Was expecting more from the menu but overall pleasant experience. They also provide outdoor heaters !', \"Nue successfully fuses different cuisines from all across the world into something very unique and satisfying. The waffles in the chengdu chicken and waffles were very light and contrasted well with the rich flavor of the chicken. The fries were very hot and freshly fried. All in all the food here is very good! The only issue I have with Nue is that the food is a little more expensive than I expected. It's also pretty loud in there.All considered, Nue is a fun brunch place to go to, they give you the bill in travel guides! But in my opinion it isn't quite worth the price of the food.\", 'Probably one of the best+interesting brunch places in Seattle. Lots of food from different corners of the world. One of my favorite places to get Shakshuka and also Philipino breakfast. Love the diversity!Protip: Bring your out of town friends here!', \"Made a reservation for this spot before we arrived in Seattle. My friend had hunted it down as one of hot spots for dinner. We sat along the window which was nice. The wine was tasty - and we ordered the mofongo, the bunny chow, Brazilian shrimp things. Overall the food was really fun - the menu is VERY diverse. I loved the Mofongo and the bunny chow was good. The Brazilian shrimp things were a little too fishy for my taste. I'd go again.\", \"Everything was so delicious when I went to Nue. \\xa0The ambience was kinda retro and cute and we sat near the windows. I ordered an shakshuka and the sunny bunny. Both were amazing!! The shakshuka paired so well with the roti and the sunny bunny's toast was nicely crisp and well paired wirh the delicious curry. The eggs weren't over cooked and was slightly runny which I love. This is the type of place I would 10/10 recommend to friends and family! I think I'd love to try more things on their menu the next time I get the chance to stop by!\", \"The Filipino tosilog is by far my favorite! The way to meat is cooked and the flavor of everything. It's definitely a GEM and highly recommend going to try it. The servers are all very friendly and patient with my questions. The environment is very comfortable as well. Can't wait to come back and try their other selections!\", 'Awesome service and desserts! I had to push my reservation back due to some low quality decision making, but they our table for quite some time which was awesome of them. Danish dream cake (bottom right) was a bit dense but otherwise very flavorful and rich - good for sharing. The south african chocolate malva (top left, reminded me of bread pudding) was spectacular - airy with just a hint of chocolate.', \"The pig tail here was soooooooooooo good! The outside was crispy and chewy, the meat was juicy, had a hint of lime flavor, was just perfect!! I also had the curry ramen (Laksa), which was okay... It was nothing much more special than other curry noodles. If you visit this place, I would definitely try the pig tails. The inside looked nice, but I visited this place when it was extremely hot, and so inside was humid and hot. There was no A/C on and the heat from the kitchen made it extremely hot. I ended up sitting outside, which was nice. If you do not like eating in warm places, and care about the A/C, visit this place when it's fall or winter... hahaUpdates! I was gratefully contacted by the owner of Nue, whom told me that the AC is in progress to be fixed! The owner for sure cares about the customers' experience and I really appreciated that. Would definitely go again and recommend you all to try as well!\", 'CHENGDU SPICY WANGSS FROM I love the presentation of these wings, they stack it highhh and sprinkle this bad boy with basil, red chili pepper, garlic, peppercorn, and datttt fish sauce! \\u2063\\u2063\\u2063\\u2063\\u2063\\u2063Although it was a great twist on your typical fried chicken, I think I still prefer Korean fried chicken or Southern style. I just like my wings extra crispy w/ a kick of that special heat', \"LOVE the chicken wings, cornbread, and cocktails here. Decor is cool too. Such a unique idea to marinate the wings with fish sauce. Cocktails are super yummy too- my favorite was the cachaca rum one, and the one with mezcal and oj. The kale salad just tasted ok and the $8 price point during happy hour seemed a bit pricey. Service-wise, I've been here three times and everyone's been friendly and helpful. The only one time it wasn't so great was when we sat at the bar and the bartender acted really grumpy towards us for some reason. But overall a positive experience and would definitely recommend, especially to people wanting to try something new and unique!\", \"I've been running ragged this past week. Despite just wanting to crash and face plant on the futon, I enjoy having the rare dinner with The College Friend. I've been respectful of her diet these past few months, so when she mentioned checking out Nue, it's like someone has been let out to play after being grounded.Very pleasant experience making reservations, free parking spot directly across the restaurant, and the host person was very gracious when we were a bit late due the southbound traffic (thanks 520 closure). Seemed I've won the dining lottery this evening even before ordering!Nue is a wonderful concept bringing the best of the world's street food without the expensive open jaws airline ticket. Love the modest layout, intriguing interior decor, and menu offerings.The College Friend decided to have the popular South African Bunny Chow ($16). No, it's not a trip to a salad bar or a crudite platter. This was a hollowed out Pullman loaf filled with chicken breast, Indian masala, lime, and cilantro. It was deemed tasty, but she would have preferred an exchange of steamed rice for the Pullman loaf.Originally, I was sold on having the Cubano sandwich. Then the helpful wait person convinced me that the Puerto Rican Mofongo ($17) was the way to go. I had only heard of this dish via the Food Network. A mound of garlic plantain mash with bacon and pulled smoked chicken sat on a platter of sofrito sauce, blistered red and green peppers, and onions. Could have done without the latter two ingredients though, just my personal preference of red over green peppers. The onions weren't sweet or caramelized, but a bit sharp and bitter. So I made a pile next to a bit of chicken gristle.Passed on this evening's three dessert offerings: liquid nitrogen ice cream (dippin dots?), egg roll burrito confection, and a malva chocolate creation. Next time though, I'll ask to sit at the counter by the bar instead. I wanted to see all the cubby holes and contents along the wall. I love to people watch, see what they ordered, and get glimpses of cooking action.Like the couple next to me indulged in the balut (even this FilAm chick (pun intended) never was brave enough to try this delicacy). Their laksa egg noodles and the tower of plump chicken wings were shared and devoured with such pleasure. Voyeurism and sheer food porn!Although the counter I was seated at faced the street, there were some interesting fashion choices witnessed, like glittery pants, leg warmers, and heels. Reservations are a must, especially if large parties take up both communal tables. Place was full shortly after 6pm.As I was weaving around the perimeter to exit, I was bid farewell by a pair of chef/line crew. Definitely, next visit I have to face the other way. Despite a fleeting glance, that was one hot man by the stove.Great dinner choice by The College Friend. A definite must for folks who love adventurous food and travel! Oh did I mention the hot guy whisking something in a 10 qt Hobart SS bowl?\", 'Excellent place. Dishes from around the world and very flavorful. Amazing cocktail menu and I loved my mocktail. Worth the drive. Easy to find parking on a Sunday.', 'Service and ambiance were great, but the food was just kind of not tasty. Nothing was wrong with it, but no one liked anything they got.', 'Came here for my birthday and they were super great and accommodating! My bf emailed in advance and made a reservation for 12-14 and they even let my friends come early to set up. I really appreciate that they were able to let us book such a large party since this restaurant is on the smaller side. I genuinely enjoyed the \"eating around the world\" experience and the unique, cozy ambiance of this restaurant. I didn\\'t order any drinks but they sounded interesting so definitely will try the next time I go! We did family style since we wanted to try a bit of everything and it was all delicious.', 'We got there 45 minutes before they closed and the wait time was 2-20 minutes on Yelp. Host said he won\\'t seat us because the waitlist was \"not a real guideline\".It was after 9pm and all the other places were closing. We wouldn\\'t have wasted half an hour to go there if we knew the waitlist wasn\\'t \"real\".Would appreciate it if the restaurant can stop using fake wait time solely as a bait to get people to go there and make them look more popular than they actually are.The food may or may not be good, but the host was definitely unprofessional and rude. Definitely recommend this place if you are meeting up with someone you don\\'t want to spend much time with. The host will for sure do his part in killing all the good vibes and cutting your dinner date short.The host also claimed to be the manager when we asked to speak to a manager. And laughed when we asked to speak to the owner.----Thanks for responding.Understand that technology is not always reliable and things break, but1). Yelp\\'s alleged technical glitch doesn\\'t justify the rudeness and the eye rolling of your restaurant\\'s host; and2). Now I wonder how many more people visited over those two weeks only to wasted hours of their time, and why, after this being a known issue for two whole weeks, the best response your host could come up with was pretty much \"none of my business, not my fault, now go away.\"We asked to talk to a manager to inform them of the vastly inaccurate wait time. He responded, with an impatient eye roll: \"I\\'m the manager.\"When I asked him if he knew where else is open in the neighborhood, he walked straight past me without an response.When we asked to speak to the owner, he laughed. There isn\\'t much we can do as a waitlist is an faith-based system that\\'s supposedly based on both sides\\' belief in each other\\'s honest intention. We aren\\'t disappointed at the restaurant because the waitlist broke. We are disappointed because the restaurant did not even intend to acknowledge or take feedback on a mistake made either by them or a vendor they use, which wastes hours of each of their customers\\' time.', \"Whoa. \\xa0Time slips by. \\xa0 I remember coming here for the soft opening with a friend. \\xa0Different time, different person and wings were on the agenda. \\xa0 It was pretty crowded but we got a couple of seats in at the bar. \\xa0Lacked a little elbow room and I'm pretty sure I got food on the dude next to me while I was eating, but no complaints. \\xa0The wings came in a tower, that looked a little scary but they were good. \\xa0We had some chicken and fries in a bag that was disappointing to me, but maybe my expectations were too high. \\xa0I thought it was still a fun time and will have to remember its close for me.\", \"We were able to attend a demo type - soft opening (thx Necia) and were able to take one of the first looks at the decor and do some tasting. \\xa0 It's a small space, with high ceilings, and large windows that face the street. \\xa0 The windows were still covered, so it was a bit darker inside that it will eventually be. \\xa0 There are several wooden lathe walls, covered with Necia's artistry. \\xa0 (I sort of wanted to hug the octopus in the corner.) \\xa0 There were a few seats along the windows and two long communal tables.The niche of Nue is going to be street foods from around the world. \\xa0 Since we have both done a little bit of international traveling, we were pretty pumped about this experience. \\xa0 First up was a starter of oink tail, with a dipping sauce. \\xa0 Not a novice to pig tail, this took me to a different place. \\xa0 Once you got through the outer skin, there was a bit of moist meat \\xa0inside that almost had a sweetnest to it. \\xa0 It was impossible to be dainty about it and we resorted to hand to hand combat, but it was a hit in my book. \\xa0A fizzy of tamarind was brought out that I really bonded with. \\xa0 I'm not a huge tamarind guy, but this was super refreshing.A salad with shrimp, green papaya and what I think was dow gauk came next. \\xa0 Nice offset to the savory oinkness going on, but the sour got to us a bit. \\xa0 This was followed by a soup of sausage and kale, which had a nice bite. \\xa0 Psh, since I had a white shirt on, I had to make sure it made a slow and steady path to my mouth to avoid spillage.The big kahuna was pork belly with kimchi, wrapped in peking duck buns, like sliders. \\xa0I thought the kimchi might overpower, but it was toned down and took you through several profiles the longer you left it in your mouth. \\xa0 It added a good textural crunch. \\xa0 The belly was sliced small enough that you didn't drag huge pieces out of the bun with every bite.Dessert was an ice cream that was whipped up with liquid nitro. \\xa0Hazelnut? \\xa0 Fun place. \\xa0 Hope the menu rotates around so that there are always different things to try and the owners actually asked for feedback on ideas, which should always keep things fresh.\", \"I'm fully aware of how it looks to be writing a negative in the midst of a pandemic, and I feel fortunate enough to even be able to afford to eat out. However, this was a huge disappointment. I've eaten at Nue in the past and it was always delicious. The Nue for 2 is just not a good value. We received 6 ribs, a salad the size of a small bowl, and 1 small piece of cornbread. It's not enough food for $54, even with the ~$8 bottle of wine. Why would any restaurant have portions for two but give 1 tiny cornbread?\", 'Loved my experience here! Got the water beetles, chicken wings, and ribs for 2.Water beetles ~$17: definitely paying for the experience and not actual food substance. Tasted like strawberry apple! Chicken wings: recommended, a bit spicy (milder than sriracha though). Ribs: fall off the bone and so flavorful. Also recommended. Wished there was a bit more rice', \"What a nice lunch spot on a rainy day; this small restaurant delivers! The brunch/lunch crowd was here and the long tables were packed with a few big groups. Luckily, as we walked inside, a couple was leaving from the window-facing seating; the hostess seated us in under 5 minutes. It was hard to choose from the menu, we spotted a few interesting entrées. I decided on the Israeli Shakshuka and my guy was eating the South African Sunny Bunny for his main dish.The $6 'flemish frites' meh, they're just fries, skip those next time! Our meals, though, were delicious, spicy, and unique! I've made shakshuka a few times at home and I really like it, Nue's was wonderful (better than mine, haha!): spicy and full of flavour. Eggs cooked in a tomato, red pepper, and feta ragout. Served with house-made zhug (Israeli hot sauce). It was accompanied by slices of flatbread to scoop up all that rich tomato sauce and eggy goodness. I got to steal a few bites of the sunny bunny...it was so good, I want to get it next time! Chicken breast, Indian masala, lime, and cilantro. Topped off with an egg and served in a Pullman bread bowl.A unique and funky spot in Capitol Hill. Can't wait to return. Would be a fun spot to bring a group.\", 'Nue looks slightly alarming on the surface, as the gringo crowd and the motley decor scream \"cultural appropriation,\" but rest assured that the globally inspired offerings are up to snuff here. In particular, happy hour is a solid bet. It\\'s offered from 3-6pm daily, as well as during the late night hours on weekends. While the house pineapple cornbread fell apart a bit too easily, at least the pineapple and coconut toppings provided an interesting twist reminiscent of \"pineapple buns\" you\\'ll find at Cantonese bakeries. The kale and carrot salad was refreshing, while the Chengdu spicy jumbo chicken wings were nicely fried and flavored, without being overwhelmingly spicy. The establishment is rather compact and most of the seating is at communal tables or counters. Service is fast and efficient, and overall this is a nice addition to this stretch of Capitol Hill. Thanks Yelpers for a good find!', 'Hidden gem in Capitol Hill between pike and pine. Wide variety of international dishes with bottomless mimosas for $20. Great spot to get brunch on the weekends. The filipino tosilog was charbroiled with rice and eggs and chose to go with a spicy bloodymary instead of mimosas. If theirs a line check for seats at the back bar. IG @backpacking_rob', \"Nue exceeded our expectations in every regard. The menu is concise, intriguing and eclectic. Each dish is a different type of refined dish representing countries around the world. We went with the pineapple cornbread, bunny chow and short ribs. Each meal was super fresh (cornbread came straight from the oven), delicious and unlike anything we'd eaten before. The bunny chow was so good I've been reading about it's origins and some competition they have in South Africa over it. Nue should enter. The cocktails were equally as interesting and delicious. We took our servers recommendations and they were spot on. While we get it, having to dine outdoors in 40 degree weather makes dining that much less comfortable. We expected another chilly dinner but every outdoor table had a makeshift personal heater that was left us eating without bulky layers. Such a game changer. Excited to visit again!!\", \"What a wonderful eclectic place. Came here for brunch and was struck by the colorful and immersive decor that immediately transports me to a Southeast Asian Backpacker's night market. The menu originates from all over, and usually such an unfocused menu might smell trouble, but everything came out well done and well presented. The trademark tower of wings was uniquely spiced, especially with its Sichuan green pepper kick. The tocino was very authentic but the scallion black pepper rice that accompanied it was particularly outstanding, I could eat it forever. At the end, the bill is delivered enclosed in a Travel guidebook, just to lock in the theme. I'd love to come back for another tour around the world!\", \"What can I say?? Best wings ever! Seriously. I can't think of any other place I've been to that even came close to their wings. I also liked the ambience, communal dining at its best.\", \"One of the coolest brunch spots in the city!I've been here 3 times and I've never been disappointed! It's always busy but I've never had an issue getting a reservation the previous day so make sure you have one. Waits can be a while depending on the day. I have tried the shakshuka, Filipino tosilog and the Chengdu chicken and waffles. They were out of the waffles yesterday and I went with the tosilog. It was delicious and I was so hungry that I forgot to take a photo before I scarfed it down! My friend got shakshuka and he really enjoyed it! They also have bottomless mimosa which is awesome.\", \"Wow, this place is amazing. They have such diverse menu selections, it's hard to pick just a few things.we must have tried at least half the things on the menu and they are all amazing from a whipped cream and sprinkles topped beer two more Nepalese and Indian themed dishes, I would not say that their menu is boring in the least. \\xa0The decor at the restaurant is very original and definitely makes for a conversation and things to look at while you're dining. \\xa0Staff is very friendly and helpful with understanding the menu. \\xa0they are not a huge restaurant so they may get busy at times we came late at night when there wasn't a crowd. \\xa0I almost got one of their T-shirts because the logo was so cool / unique looking but changed my mind at the last minute. \\xa0If you like boring food steer clear from this place because you will not like it, but if you have a dating palate and enjoy food you will love this place!\", 'Nue is an Asian restaurant concept specializing in experimental dishes incorporating different cuisines from around the world into a small menu of surprisingly harmonious and delicious dishes. They try not to pigeonhole themselves into trendy terms like \"farm to table\" or \"fusion\" and it\\'s quite evident in their food, decor, and atmosphere. The concept of \"foodways\" is the best way to describe the restaurant\\'s vision as they seek to explore the intersection of food in culture, traditions, and history.We visited Nue on a weekday night after work to celebrate one of our friends\\' birthday. Because the restaurant is so small reservations must be made in advance for large parties. After everyone arrived we were handed menus and each ordered a dish to try. I believe the best way to approach the menu with a group of friends is to each order a different item so you can share between friends family-style at the table.I personally ordered the bunny chow after hearing so much about it from Anthony Bourdain\\'s show and tweets. Bunny Chow is essentially a hollowed out loaf of white bread filled with curry. It has a unique history in foodways: it\\'s one of the earliest fast foods in history and originated when Indian migrant workers needed a way to transport food to the fields in South Africa. It was born out of necessity and has now become a popular dish among South Africans.Nue\\'s Bunny Chow was just how I imagined it would taste. Fluffy, pillowy white bread filled with dark, rich chicken masala. The chicken was tender and cooked perfectly and the masala had a spicy and deep body to the flavor. The cilantro and lime added just enough brightness and acidity to balance out the dish.Among the other dishes I tried were the Chengdu wings and the crickets. The wings had a nice balance of sweet, spicy, and sour with a strong basil flavor. The crickets were...interesting to say the least and the flesh tasted eerily like candy.I love how Nue is able to take flavors and techniques from around the world and incorporate them into a dish without bastardizing or disrespecting their origin. The team behind the concept are true pioneers in the culinary industry and I can\\'t wait to see what they have to offer in the future.', \"LOVE Nue for brunch!! This is the place I take friends and visitors to really impress them.Nue takes reservations, which is a huge bonus. If you hate waiting for your brunch and get hangry like me, just check online a few days in advance and you'll be good to go.ALWAYS start with the war chips. I know, peanut satay on french fries sounds kind of weird, but trust me. These fries have literally everything - they're crunchy, hot, sweet, and savory. You'll be hooked at first bite. I usually get the tosilog or mofongo and they are both delicious. My husband has also gotten the chicken and waffles and LOVES them - he wants to leave brunch STUFFED and that does the trick.Service is attentive - they are always topping up coffee and bringing more water. It's a bit pricey but seriously worth it for a really unique and delicious brunch.\", \"Have been curious to check out a restaurant based upon street food from all over the world. \\xa0The decor is pretty awesome as it reflects a global influence and they have happy hour from 5-6pm which discounts a couple bucks off house cocktails and offers some food items as well.We ordered two happy hour items: \\xa0pig tails and grilled octopus. \\xa0Have to admit, I had to mentally get over the concept of eating pig tails, but the servers kept saying it was so good and we needed to try it, so we did. \\xa0It was very fatty and rich, but the meat on the tails were actually pretty good. \\xa0The grilled octopus was also tender and good, but would probably opt to order something different next time.Entree dish wise, we had trouble deciding since so many dishes looked interesting, but we finally settled on trying the goat curry. \\xa0It was definitely savory, the pineapple coconut cornbread it came with was super good, but definitely opt to get a side of rice with it as well. \\xa0It is pretty heavy and rich, and the rice helps to cut down on it a bit. \\xa0We did not get to try it, but I am curious about the seafood laksa and the chicken wings... perhaps will try that at another time.Cocktails and in house liquor concoctions are interesting... there's a bottle with a snake eating a scorpion, a science looking contraption where scotch, everclear, and a bunch of other herbs and liquors (it was actually pretty tasty) were mixed together, a bottle with huge beetles in them... the liquor smelled really good, but the beetles... we didn't try that one, but definitely interesting. \\xa0and I'm sure there's more we didn't see. \\xa0The one thing I will say that was quite distracting was that while the servers were very friendly, they would often sit there, eaves drop on our conversations and then suddenly interject and even join in on our conversation, uninvited, which I found was very odd. \\xa0Perhaps it was because we were sitting in the bar area and the restaurant wasn't too busy yet, but still...One time I could understand, but it happened over and over again during the course of our time there, which I felt was inappropriate, awkward and eventually started to feel kind of annoying after a while.\", \"Oh yes!!!! I was skeptical when I saw the menu but holy cow was I happy after that satisfying meal. Let's cut straight to the chase and talk about what to order. My faves were the Brussels sprouts and the lamb skewers for apps. So good that we ordered two rounds! But what really rocked my world was the South African bunny chow - such a Unique dish with an incredible blend of spices that you won't find anywhere else in Seattle (actually the case with all the dishes). The best is the sauce that soaks into the soft bread, mouthwatering!Like I said, dishes are unique so there'll always be something that people don't like. Our entire table was not a fan of the cashew curry, too much cashew action and not much else. We also didn't love the sweet tangy flavor of the kale salad, so next time we'll do without. Love that ambiance is causal to match the street food theme. Benches and tables, kitchen behind a counter, and that's really all you get. Menu features street food from all over the world, not sure how authentic it was, but I can say it was tasty! Can't wait to go back.\", 'Stopped in here for our final lunch in Seattle before heading back home to SF. THIS PLACE IS SO YUMMY!!!!!!!!!! Every dish we got had great flavor and everything tasted fresh and delicious! I just wanted to write a quick review for all my fellow yelpers (who rely on yelp like I do!).. if you are considering coming here- do it!Just be sure to come with a few friends so you can all order something different and share :) SUPER FRIENDLY staff and awesome decor too!', \"We went there for my friend's birthday during their happy hours. Because it was in the early afternoon, we were able to do the street parking. I felt like walking to some kind of display room,filled with global souvenirs and surprises. Open kitchen on the left, you can eat and watch those deco in the same time. Lots of options from all over the world on the menu. We loved the brussels sprouts and kale salad. It's flavorful and tasty.I liked Brazilian Acaraje because it taste like crab cake. Being a fan of coconut, their house made pineapple cornbread was good. \\xa0Chicken wings were a little bit over seasoned but the presentation was amazing! In the end, we tried the desserts special, vietnamese and french toast & bacon ice creams. They were delicious. The service was great and he was very friendly and helpful since it's our first time. I liked the idea that the check book was a guidebook. It's a fun place to hang out with friends and try something new.\", \"Good:- Lively ambience.- Eclectic and very tasty food.Not so good:- Community seating, meaning you'll share a table with strangers. I've seen this at some other joints too, but here, there's very little personal space among parties. Depending on who you're sitting beside, this can be an annoyance. My friend and I were sat adjacent to a group who clearly work together. How do I know? Because they were obnoxiously loud and inconsiderate of others.- Servers not very attentive; no one refilled our water bottle.- Not all servers are friendly. I asked for a clean \\xa0plate for the 2nd item we ordered, and the server seemed reluctant in doing that.- Price is slightly on the higher side. But that's not unexpected from a popular eatery in Seattle.I'd go again.\", \"Superb food. Bring a couple of friends who aren't picky about their food, and order a bunch of items to share. Everything is incredibly flavorful. I love that each dish tastes so uniquely different from all the others. You really can't go wrong with this place! RSVP ahead of time though -- it gets jam packed.\", \"Omg ! If it was possible , I would give it 10 stars \\xa0absolutely loved this place! The chicken wings were good but the bunny chow was BRILLIANT! The Indian spice taste was very authentic. The wings had a nice crunch and tinch of spice \\xa0I got the corn bread too but didn't like it as much. Pro tip ~ make a reservation and do not be later than 15 mins to it! They are very very busy and will give away your table.\", \"Came here with a group of friends for dinner when I went to visit Seattle. The restaurant has a really interesting way of decorating it's space. There is a ton of stuff going on when you enter but I guess it keeps you entertained while waiting for your food. This place isn't very big either so I would suggest making reservations prior to going. Reminder that this place is a tapa style restaurant so the portions aren't large. Would recommend eating family style so that you can try a little bit of everything.Chicken Heart Poppers - Yummy! It tastes like popcorn chicken but with chicken hearts. I loved the crunchiness to it and all the flavor it had on the outside. Kale & Carrot Salad - Nothing too great about this and for the price of it, I wouldn't really recommend getting it. Our group only got it since we haven't really had any vegetables the entire trip. Puerto Rican Mofongo - Pricey for what you get but not bad. I've never had Puerto Rican food so I wanted to try this out. The mash plantain as rice was pretty interesting. It kind of reminded me of the texture of a tamale. However, the plantain didn't have much flavor. The sofrito sauce on it definitely helped give this plate so more taste to it. Chengdu Spicy Jumbo Chicken Wing - A definite must try at this restaurant. The chicken wing was SO GOOD! It had a ton of flavor and a nice crunch to it. The presentation for this dish was amazing too. It came out like a pyramid. Who could complain when a stack of chicken wing gets presented to you. The only downside about this dish is that it takes a while to come out. Jagertee Cocktail - Interesting... is all I can say about this drink. This isn't a typical cocktail because it is served hot. It literally is a cup of hot tea with some alcohol in it.\", \"This place is fantastic. Sometimes the wait can be a little long, but it's so worth it. Their cocktails are amazing, and their Chengdu chicken wings are fire. If you ever get the chance to stop by during brunch get the chicken and waffles, if not, just get the tower of wings because it's a must-try food.\", \"Came here for brunch and both my friend and I liked the restaurant overall! Friendly staff and the food was pretty good.I ordered the tosilog plate and really liked it! The one thing that did throw me off about the dish was that there were uncooked pieces of rice I believe! The rice was super good but every now and then when I would chew, I'd get a really hard bite and it would catch me completely off guard! Other than that, I highly recommend the dishKnocking off 1 star because I believe the restaurant is a bit too overpriced. For 2 people, 2 dishes and 1 side and 2 drinks, we paid almost $70 if not more. There were plenty of other places in the area that were more reasonably priced.\", \"There's something really special about Nue that you won't find at other restaurants. The moment you enter the door, there's that brief instance where you can forget you're in Seattle and immerse yourself into a new place.Corny, yes... but as I read through the menu, each dish had a different country origin. From Syrian to South African to Hungarian to Jamaican... there are so many different options to choose from. I had the Malaysian Curry Laksa ($16) split with a friend, which ended up being the perfect portion size for two people who were kind of hungry, but not starving.It consisted of seafood curry, egg noodle, caramelized coconut cream, prawn, fish balls, egg, sambal, red pepper, and rau ram. Oh my goodness, it was delicious. The dish was beautifully plated, delivered in a reasonable amount of time (not too fast, not too slow), and it was so tasty.The service was also great, with the server checking in on us. The check comes in a little travel book, which really was the cherry on top.\", 'First impressions of Nue- cute hipster Brooklyn-esque decor, complete with hanging lights, street signs and handmade plywood bookshelves.The menu here is super fun, culturally diverse, and very tasty. Offerings included Chengdu chicken (LOVE), Tunnisian Fatuur (OK, would suggest to try something else), Israeli Shakshuka, and Filipino Tosilog.', \"A true hodgepodge of Asian inspired food (which usually doesn't work out too well but in this case, it was awesome!). Would highly recommend family style so you can try more things and portions are fair and slightly larger than tapas plates. The tea leaf salad is a great starter (good for your vegetarian friends). Our personal favorites were the chengdu chicken wings, South African sunny bunny, and East Indies Brussels sprouts. Bold Asian flavors in every bite!Also, come during happy hour for a few bucks off their popular plates.\", 'Interesting and creativity concept to combine different cultural food into one place. They offer normal food like noodles and curry to exotic food like balut (duck egg - a Philippino delicacy) and water beetles. We came here because we stayed in the Capitol Hill neighborhood during our visit so it was convenient and it had great Yelp review.We ordered the goat curry and the chengdu wings. The duck curry with the cornbread was delicious, other then it being a tag bit salty, we still loved it. The chengdu wings was awesome! 6 big jumbo pieces! I love love LOVE wings and so far my favorite is still the wings from San Tung restaurant in San Francisco. Although these chengdu wings are definitely a top choice for me in my wings experience. Price is a bit high but given how different and unique the food is and probably harder to find elsewhere, I would recommend it if you are adventurousAlso the waiters are super nice and friendly, which is always a plus!', \"Nue have been on my list for a really long time, but I have never found the time to go there as it was out of the way... until today.The place was a little hard to find as I was expecting a nice fancy little restaurant. But it was almost like a hole in the wall, small cozy, filled with international decorations.I was having a really hard time deciding on what to order here because theres so much that I want to try, but I ended up getting the chicken and waffles because I heard so much about the chicken. The portion is pretty good, you get 4 piece of big chicken wings and legs with 4 piece of waffles. The wings were good, it has a nice crunch, and the inside was tender. The fish sauce that they use over the chicken was amazing, it brought back memories of being in Asia. I also love that they use real Thai chillies, the ones that are actually spicy. I was super excited that I asked for a small dish of the peppers to add on to my dish. The waffles itself was also good, crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. They are not the best chicken and waffles in tasted, but the flavoring and the execution was on point. It was really hard to use fork and knife with this dish so imagine a person with a piece of chicken in one hand and a waffle in the other, taking a bite out of the chicken, and then dipping bthe waffles in butter and syrup and biting that with the other. Cause that was what I was doing hahaha.Overall, I'm so glad to try this place. I want to come back to try their other twists on other international food.Btw: if you are going to order this dish, have hand wipes (they provide you with one) and gum ready, you are going to need it :D\", \"This place seems really cool, and the people are very nice. But I just don't think I've had a great meal here. I've been here two times now. The first time I had the rabbit chow and the wings and they were OK. They weren't super flavorful but I was full at the end. The second time I had the Szechuan wings and again it wasn't super flavorful but it was in consistently spicy. When I say inconsistently spicy, I mean that for the most part the wings were somewhat bland, but they left the peppers chopped and seeded so when you but into one, it was a burst of burning. Then you went back to the bland wings.At the end, the price just didn't feel like it was worth the food, in that the spices and flavor were just sprinkled on to conserve the supply. If you do come here, I do recommend getting the pineapple cornbread. Both times I've had it, it was pretty good.\", \"First time in Seattle and my cousin suggested to do brunch here. Got dropped off in the Uber and was lost. I was roaming around for 5 minutes until I found this little place. I walked in and wow was it crowded or what! Luckily they were there before me. The inside is very tiny, no wonder you need reservations prior, which is why I'm giving this place a 4 stars. I could hear the neighbors conversations and I'm pretty sure they could hear ours. It was just super cramped with very little wiggle room. Onto the food- ok ok, that makes up for the lack of size this restaurant has. The curry was basically Indian curry I can get at home, but it was delicious! The fries were so good, I could eat them everyday! But let me get to the best part- the kale salad! I usually never order a salad when I'm on vacation, but wow this salad was beyond excellent. Whatever dressing they used complimented the kale and the walnuts (which I usually don't prefer in my salads either.) It was bottomless drinks, but after a night out in Seattle I decided to stay away. The check came in a book, which was a cute little touch.\", \"This cozy Cap Hill spot houses an amazingly wide range of dishes for brunch and dinner. The atmosphere is warm with interesting Asian/Native-inspired trinkets and art adorning the walls.My personal favorite is their Chengdu Fried Chicken & Waffles offered during brunch (they also offer the fried chicken as a dish during dinner). The fried chicken is the perfect combination of crispy/juicy/tender and the peppercorns add a nice kick to the dish.I've also had the Filipino Tosilog -- a comforting dish, but not one of Nue's standouts in my opinion. Their pineapple cornbread with toasted coconut flakes on top is a bit dry and crumbles too easily.Happy Hour runs every day from 3-6pm and later on the weekend -- solid deal for some of their signature dishes!\", 'Came here on a Saturday night with two friends. \\xa0Three dishes we ordered were knock outs. The disappointing dish was honestly was to be expected: the beetles were really pricey for what ended up being mostly novelty, without much taste or presentation and poor.Our favorite dish was the Brazilian Acarajé ($20). \\xa0This was made of delicious black beans fritters that were split and stuffed like little tacos. \\xa0The filling was made of spicy prawns and cashews and it was a revelation. \\xa0I would order it again in a heartbeat.The Balinese barbecued spare ribs ($35) were expensive for ribs, but deliciously tender and marinated in a sweet sauce.The Chengdu spicy chicken wings ($18) came in a tall tower of hot, crispy fried wings and we loved the spicy, fish sauce, lime, basil, and mint combo.Finally, the Thai Mang Da Na ($17). \\xa0This was a plate with three big water beetles. That\\'s literally all there is to it. \\xa0The server just dropped this plate off at our table, and so my boyfriend and I figured we were supposed to just bit into the bugs. Well, their exoskeletons are quite tough and very, VERY salty (like they had been soaked in brine). \\xa0Another server who seemed very amused came by and explained to use that you are supposed to actually peel the bugs. \\xa0And then she picked up one of our beetles with her bare hands (which actually really horrified me, because she didn\\'t even ask and I don\\'t know how clean her hands are) and proceeded to show us how you pull off the wings and the head and suck the juices out. \\xa0The \"intense flavors of flowers\" described in the menu was true in that there was a strong flower scent, but there was very little actual taste to it, besides salt. \\xa0I wouldn\\'t order it again, and I don\\'t say this because they were bugs (I\\'ve eaten crickets before and thought they were just fine). \\xa0The price just seemed really high for something that wasn\\'t even made into that much of an experience.The tables are very closely packed together and the place is loud. \\xa0They ran out of most of their desserts the night we were there so we weren\\'t able to try any.Overall, the restaurant have as interesting concept and some good dishes, but don\\'t feel a need to prove yourself by ordering the beetles.', \"The chicken wings were so good! I would go back again.Tip: Make a reservation. It's a small, cozy restaurant.\", 'Chicken wings where great. \\xa0Beetles and beetlejuice drink not so much (though not as gross as expected.). \\xa0Overall entertaining meal.', \"This is such a fun, unique, and delicious spot. I have only gone for dinner, but everything I've ever tried here has been great, full of flavor, and memorable. Service has always been excellent, and I just love the way they've designed the space, full of trinkets and things from around the world that create such a cool ambience and make me want to travel. Great spot to take a date and try something new. Highly recommend getting several dishes and sharing!\", \"Delicious and different, Nue is serving up tasty and exotic fusion dishes. This quaint little restaurant located in Capitol Hill in Seattle is off the beaten path, you won't find it on the main street it's on a quiet block. I Nue (pun intended) I was going to like the restaurant as soon as I walked in based on the cool decor, long tables, and their daily happy hour from 3-6 PM-can't go wrong! The house white wine is pretty good a tad watery, but it'all do the trick. Visiting Seattle I expected to eat fun and different foods and Nue did exactly that for me since I ended up eating a lot of burgers and seafood, which I thoroughly enjoyed, but I def wanted to have a fun foodie experience. As soon as my bf and I sat down we picked at least 6 things we wanted to try, the menu had a little bit of everything and we wanted to try a little bit of it all, so we dove right in. We ordered the following: Pineapple Cornbread, Grilled Barbadian Pig Tails, Chengdu Spicy Jumbo Chicken Wings, Balut - Vietnamese Hot Vit Lon (Developed Duck Egg, Assorted Herbs, Salt, Pepper, Lime Juice)- my boyfriend had this when he went to Vietnam and couldn't believe this restaurant had it, but it's def an acquired taste. And finally the Cambodian Salor Kari Sap Curry (Chinese Eggplant, Lemongrass, Basil, Rich Vegetable & Mushroom Stock, Lime Leaf, Chili, Coconut Milk and Pickled Vegetable, which is pictured and my main. I found the Cambodian curry, spicy, fresh, and filling, all the flavors complemented each other perfectly. I am not an avid curry eater so I was a little nervous for this dish, but I was satisfied with it. The cornbread was good, but not the best, the wings were very good, extremely tasty, and not crazy spicy, I recommend them if you're a wing person. My bf loved the pigtails, he thought they were excellent, he didn't share any of them and I trust his opinion he's a bigger foodie than I am! The bf did say the Developed Duck Egg was not excatly like Vietnam, but it was pretty good.Overall if you're looking to try something culturally shocking and different head to Nue, you won't regret it!\", \"Yum! I've been here several times. My faves: Burmese salad with fermented tea leaves, Chengdu wings (needs more spice for that region), Bali spare ribs, Pineapple coconut cornbread (it's smaller in size than I think it was before!!!), Bunny chow, goat curry. Pass on : pig tail, Cambodian curry.Service is good, seating is communal, drinks are good. Reasonably priced.\", \"A-OK food and service, but very diverse menu and very cool interior & decorations.Came here for Friday dinner for our first night in Seattle! They still accepted a good amount of customers even though they were about to close, so that's nice. But service was meh, not that friendly either, got a partially rude/ sarcastic remark when I asked a question about a dish (but maybe it was a long day?)The menu is definitely very diverse across all cuisines, and things you wouldn't normally see (i.e. balut, chicken hearts, water beetle, goat :0). They had late night happy hour/ specials as well! Check comes in a travel guide book, so cute. RECOMMEND:- brussels spouts, $9 (so good we ordered it twice! crispy &on HH too)- bunny chow, $18 (chicken curry basically in a brick toast, good flavor)- chengdu spicy jumbo wings, $15 (on HH; crispy and stacked like a tower, not that spicy unless you eat the red chilies!)I did not like the goat curry, $21 (veryyy strong). The chicken hearts and the pineapple cornbread were just okay. But overall kudos to their unique menu!\", \"the food was so amazing i cant say nothing else. the place is so cute and nicely decorated too! no matter how the service was the food def made this place five stars. also the bunny chow is actually made with chicken but it's one thing that would draw me back to this place\", 'Some restaurants feel like fate. \\xa0And - for me at least - Nue is one of them.I ended up here completely by accident. \\xa0A friend had suggested this spot, and I bookmarked it in Yelp intending to visit \"someday.\" \\xa0Ironically, just 30 minutes later, I found myself seated at one of their large, communal tables perusing a happy hour menu. \\xa0Yep, definitely fate!Nue specializes in street food from around the world. \\xa0Unique, interesting items you might find at a street cart in Bangkok or a hole-in-the-wall in Hungary have found their way to this intimate spot on Capital Hill. \\xa0We started with the pineapple cornbread (epic!) and their unique take on French Fries, then worked our way to the Brussels Sprouts, pigtails (yes, pigtails) and Hungarian chicken wings. \\xa0Every choice was interesting, unique, and delicious. \\xa0And (bonus) the happy hour prices made it all very affordable.There were even some more unique offerings on the menu, like deep fried beetles and (!) balut; but I wasn\\'t feeling brave enough to try them. \\xa0Next time, next time!', 'Went there for Saturday brunch.Environment - Interesting decoration, except for the table, which they had food debris in the gap (see picture), personally I think it is pretty disgusting. Never understand why restaurants would choice those kind of table (seen it before at Miyabi 45th, glad they are permanently closed).Service - The waiter is pretty good, but the woman who bus/clean the table was bit rude.Food:Flemish Frites - MehIsraeli Shakshuka - Meh, I think Fat Hen has better ShakshukaTower of Chengdu Wings - I think the dish should be renamed to Bangkok Wings, since the only ingredient they listed that is related to Chengdu would be Szechuan Peppercorn, and the rest of the ingredient remind me more of Thai than Chengdu. The texture was bit funny, maybe the wing was defrosted in a short period of time.South African Sunny Bunny - The only dish that taste good, but I think it is pretty hard to mess up things with masala in it, and it was quite pricey.Overall:Food is pretty meh, and pricey, most likely not going to go there again.', \"Really unique restaurant with a great variety of food from different cultures!Giving this 4 stars because the seating was really cramped and it was really hot inside. Also it's a little pricey. Walked in without a reservation around 8pm on a Friday and got seated within 5 minutes.But, the food was incredible. The East Indies Brussels Sprouts were covered in toasted coconut and had really tasty dipping sauce. I had the Syrian Kale & Carrot Salad and it was surprisingly filling for a small salad. That being said it was still on the smaller end and should've been priced more as a side salad, not an entree. The feta and nuts on it were really good. My boyfriend had the South African Bunny Chow and loved it! I don't eat meat but I tried some of the bread and sauce that came with it, and it was great. Really nice blend of spices. I had 2 glasses of their champagne which was bubbly and fruity!The interior was very pretty with the paintings on the wall, decorated shelves and lights. Definitely a trendy restaurant with interesting food. I recommend!\", 'TOWER OF WINGS!!! \\xa0Get the wings!!! \\xa0Mouth-watering goodness. \\xa0Came here with coworkers for lunch and man, i had thought i would have some fried chicken to share...but nope. \\xa0Ate. It. All. \\xa0Nice little place for all kinds of fusion street food. \\xa0Definitely a must try when in Seattle. \\xa0Wish i was in our Seattle office more often so i could try the other dishes... Oh well, till next time.']\n"
